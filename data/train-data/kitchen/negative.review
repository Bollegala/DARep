He just looks away from where the spray emits--and barks again!

Buyer Beware
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Having read the other reviews of this product on this site, I decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered.  I ordered three of these products from this site, and when they arrived, not a single one of them worked - at all.  They were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested, these products are completely useless.  Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged.  Thus, your credit card will still be billed, your dogs will still be barking, and you may get stuck with products that are worthless.

Only sprays intermittently with my cocker spaniel (15 lb.)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.

This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time

I bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier. He didn't even notice it was there. I put it near his crate and it still didn't stop him from barking.  I pushed the manual button and still nothing.  It promises to stop annoying barking, but it didn't stop my dog for one minute.  It was a complete waste of my money

Read the description carefully. It states the speaker range is 50' not the microphone. My dog stood 10' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn't trigger. Matter of fact I never could get it to trigger with barking. The only time it did go off was when I put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand. Even then it didn't go off till I was about 4 feet from the mower.

Super Bark Free didn't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor's dog's extremely irritating ear-piercing loud barking - he merely ignored it (though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet). I'm mad that I wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product.

The one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn't! This thing blows more air than it sucks dirt. What a useless thing. I'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor. This thing certainly doesn't do it! If you're looking to buy this thing, look again -- there MUST be something better if not just your regular broom

Don't use with batteries!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The design for using the DC adapter with LED Booklight is extremely poor. It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.

My continuing crusade against gizmos:
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
There are a lot of theoretically good ideas that  fail when executed. This is one of them. 1/QUALITY:It's made cheaply, and even before it breaks, it's flimsiness does not inspire confidence. 2/RESISTANCE:The levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks,(many will be unchallenged right from the beginning). The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There's a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually  helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by  claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle  lying down (??) to do crunches is, we've reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT. It seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort. Unfortunately, exercise IS effort, and the more you avoid effort, the less exercise you get

I was really hopeful about this product working.  I have four dogs, ages 2 through 8.  I tried and tried to teach them how to use this product, but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button.  They just ignored the paw and wouldn't ever put their paw on it to even touch it

Too flimsy!   Light also not that bright.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me.  I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!  I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes & Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light

Poor quality
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Why does this light cost 30$? For this price and supposedly a bunch of "design awards", I find this light to be of extremely poor quality. The connection between the chord and the a/c adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension. The chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on. I am still looking for a better alternative, but for the price, this light isn't worth the investment.

I bought this for my mother-in-law at her request.  She has arthritis and saw it on TV.  She also wanted the free gripper that came with it.  I scoured the listings at Amazon looking for one that included the gripper, even paid a little more for it.  She used the can opener once and it broke.  The "free" gripper required sending away for it and an inflated S&H fee

The can has to be 100% dent free for this to work.  If you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can, this thing won't open your product.  A great idea, but this needed a little more refinement.

Old Technology Fat Separator
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Once upon a time, not too long ago, they made and sold fat separators that permitted the juice to flow out from the bottom of the separator. This meant that the cook could harvest all of the juice, plus the tasty bits,  instead of, as with this product, having to strain the sauce first (for the  bits) and then sacrifice some of the sauce (a small amount to be sure),  lest the fat start to flow through the spout as well. This product is  really just a step away from spoon and ice cube, and not a big step,  considering that it's not a complete solution. If the cooks's purpose were  to collect the fat--e.g., chicken schmalz--free from juices, it would  present the same problems

Works well on carpets not to well anywhere else.  The hose attachment is horrible, the hose is about 4 ft long and stiff and is not permanently attached to the vacuum, and when you try to clean furniture the movement losens it and it comes off.  I have 2 dogs and 3 cats and I need to be able to clean the furniture.  Also when you could use the hose on something all the dirt piled up on the floor where the vacuum stood, it was not pulled into the bag. Very disappointed with it and would not recommend to anyone with pets.

The Bad Reviews Are Right -- Don't Buy It!!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I decided to give this product a shot. Some reviewers said the bags would work properly if you don't overstuff them -- still not true! A Large bag re-inflated when I put 2 standard pillows in it. So I took out 1 pillow and tried again, and the bag was nowhere near being full. It seemed to work all right, but the next morning the pillow had re-inflated! And if you buy the bags with the zippers, the zippers come off easily, they make sealing more difficult, and one even tore a hole in the bag. I purchased straight from AsSeenOnTV.com, but their return policy looks a little weird. I'm not sure if I'll get a refund. Also be careful if you order straight from AsSeenOnTV.com -- I upgraded to express shipping and got my package 12 days later! I guess the product was just too good to be true.

This is the worst basting brush I have ever encountered.  At first countless bristles fell out in my food and every time I washed it.  (Although it's dishwasher safe, it failed to come clean in there, even after a big squirt of dawn and much hand washing it isn't spotless, but I think I pulled most of the loose bristles out in the process.)  It also doesn't stand up to any heat, I use it to lightly grease my griddle for pancakes and things (at about 375 degrees) becuase I don't like the residue left by Pam, and it shrinks and flakes bristle bits every time.  I also don't like the Good Grips in general (these were a gift) the handles are too bulky and take up too much space in my utensil crock and limited apartment kitchen drawers

Last year, I bought a Pizza Stone from Pampered Chef.  It was a rousing success with my family.  For the 5 of us, however, one stone was not enough and I wanted a companion that would help provide two delicious pizzas at one time.  Sadly, the product did not come through.  My pizza stuck to the stone and had to be scraped off.  I tried going against the directions and didn't preheat the stone the second time.  It stuck even worse!  The pizza didn't get fully done in the middle, while the Pampered Chef pizza was perfect both times.  I will be throwing the stone away and ordering the higher priced alternative from Pampered Chef.  You get what you pay for!!

I thought I was getting a true cooking stone - but it is only a bread stone.  Cannot cook other foods on it. I thought I was getting something similar to pampered chef cooking stone where I could cook meat, cookies, etc. and it seasoned the stone as it was used.  If all you want is pizza or bread this may be the item - but it is VERY limited in use for the amount of space it takes up in the cabinet.

Purchased the unit about 6 months ago and have never been happy with it. The heating plate under the pot started to rust; the pot leaks every time it's poured; it's almost impossible to pour water into the water chamber without spilling it; the handle of the coffee basket broke within a few months; and two days ago the entire top of the unit snapped off when we opened it to pour in the water. We purchased this unit because of the Cuisinart brand and the stainless steel carafe. We will not purchase another

I ordered this after reading that it "includes 6 18 ounce bowls". This is bad advertising. I ordered 2 sets and only received 2 bowls.  After I wrote to customer service and asked for the additional 10 bowls per the offer.  Amazon refused to send them and thanked me for "pointing out an error".  In 2 days Amazon has not even corrected the ad. Beware of this product and offer and know that Amazon has not made good on its offer. I have ordered many products from this site, but will be more skeptical in the future, and will only order an item if it is an individual item with a name brand that I can track

Average results - burned flavor
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
I am a big fan of espresso and espresso drinks but needed to save money so I bought this to make it at home. Making espresso is easy enough if you follow the instructions (I didn't watch the video). The frother even works well. The problem I had was with the flavor. The manual suggests making two or four shots of espresso at a time, but when making four shots the espresso was badly burned by the time it was finished brewing. I had best results making just over one shot at a time, but the flavor was still burned and flat. In the end, I used the machine for a couple months but eventually put it away and went back to my regular drip coffee maker

Love those Irobot products and everything they're capable of doing.  In fact, this was my third purchase, but my first remanufactured product.  What a headache!  The product worked correctly just three times, then died. Both technical support and customer service from Irobot were helpful and prompt, but still took weeks to resolve the issues. I tried a different way of recharging, which didn't work.  Then they replaced the battery, but that still didn't solve the problem.  Ultimately I had to send the product back, then waited more than a month for a replacement, which was on backorder.  Finally, they substituted a different model, and which works just as advertised.  I'd never buy another remanufactured model.  But I still believe in Irobot.

Terrible ergonomics!  It was SO difficult and uncomfortable to keep the trigger engaged and carve at the same time.  My hand was ACHING by the time I'd carved the brisket.  I've never used a more awkward or uncomfortable appliance

This grill is better in theory than practice.  I'm not sure it heats to the temp it shows on the display and it really isn't practical for steaks except very thin ones.  It's pretty handy for hamburgers and also makes good panini sandwiches.  I haven't tried some of the other recipes so I can't really comment on anything else.  It is easy to clean, so that's a plus

The only thing this juicer is good for is to find out if you will really be into juicing.  This juicer lasted for 3 months while juicing 3 to 5 times a week (for two people).  At 3 months the tray that holds the blade warped and started spitting plastic into the drink.  I considered getting another one to have spare parts....then I scraped that idea and got a real juicer.  Besides being cheaply made...it should also be priced cheaper.  Also the blade takes a while to clean

I felt disapointed with the quality of this bake set. The grill cover started to desapair, and the last time I cooked a stek using this set, the paint sticked to the meat, leaving black spots. It started to show deteriorazion and everytime I washed I have to dried it up immediately otherwise mark of rust starts to show soon.

The temperature markings on this thermometer are not protected!  Over time the markings get occluded by grease and if you try to wash the grease off the markings come with it. This means the thermometer has a short life span for people who rely on the markings for anything (which granted is not everyone).  Last time I buy an oven thermometer in which the markings don't sit behind a glass face!

Lock problem
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Had to return the first one because of a lock malfunction (it locked but would not unlock).  Amazon was great about responding immediately and replacing it promptly.  However, the lock on the second one does not work properly, either (it doesn't lock), though I will keep it, since keeping little hands safe is not an issue in my home. This item is a good way of storing blades and disks, but unless Cuisinart comes up with a more reliable locking mechanism, don't count on it to protect small hands from getting into it.

You truly get what you pay for in this case.  We bought the red ones and they have left fuzzies all over the house.  In the dryer, you need to check the lint trap frequently, as they shed like mad.  They are not smooth and cozy, they have a very high coefficient of friction and it's sorta hard to scootch around on them.  I would not recommend.

When it works, this blender does a fine job, and looks great.  However, our first one quit turning the blades in less than a year. We sent it in, after MANY calls to customer service, and they kept the darned thing for 3 months before deciding to send us a replacement.  The replacement lasted only 2 years before the blades broke.  During that 2 years, we figured out that our extra set of blades didn't fit in bottom ring properly, and allowed fluid to pour through the motor.  Great.  I should have save up to buy a vitamix instead

DEFECTIVE AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
On 8/15/06, I purchased and Irobot Roomba Scheduler. Within one month of purchase, it failed completely and would not work at all. On the Irobot website, it claims that their customer service department is open 24/7, and they guarantee a reply to an email within 24 hours. I sent an email, and I never heard anything back from them at all. After a week, I called their technical support line, and I waited on hold for 38 minutes before being able to speak to a technician, who swiftly determined that my unit was defective and needed to be replaced. I was told to mail in my defective unit and that another one would be shipped to me. It is now 11/9/2006 and I have received nothing and heard nothing from Irobot. DO NOT PURCHASE ONE OF THESE UNITS UNLESS THIS KIND OF PRODUCT UNRELIABILITY AND ABYSMAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS APPEALING TO YOU.

Well, I'm not terribly impressed with this metal rotary grater.  Yes, it will grate cheese, but the gap between the drum and compartment that holds the cheese is a little over 1/4 of an inch.  This allows for the cheese to get 'gummed' up and eventually that large wad just falls through.  Also, for harder cheeses this means you're constanty picking out chunks of cheese that should have been grated.

I bought this to replace my old Mouli grater which finally bit the dust.  Big mistake.  It is sturdy and reasonably well designed, but  the grating surfaces barely work at all, or at least mine didn't.  To get it to grate cheese takes a long time and a lot of muscle, so much so that you are likely to start wondering how badly you really want the grated cheese.  I tried the grater drum on reasonably fresh Parmesan and later tried the shredder drum on Jarlsberg.  Neither drum worked satisfactorily. That may be because it is made in China where hard western-style cheese is nearly unknown.  Yeah I  know it says MIU France but the box clearly says "Made in China".  I finally got so mad I threw it out in frustration

Well, I just got my blender, real excited to use it, filled it up with the ingredients, flipped on the switch , and within 5 seconds it started smoking, badly, and then died.  I turned it off and tried to turn it on again, and all it did was make a grumbly noise.  So I am sending it back and sticking with my old Hamilton that I have had for 9 years.  Why did I quit using it in the first place.  $20 blender and it made a perfect smoothie.  $79 for this Waring and it crashed and burned on me.  My advice is it looks nice, but it isn't worth the money, especially since it died right away on me.  Oh well...

Completely Ineffective Candy Thermometer
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
When I bought this item I attempted to test it in hot water. My only comparison was another grocery store thermometer which wasn't accurate.  It appeared to register better than the grocery store model.  However, when using it to make chocolate fudge, by the time it registered 225 degree's, the fudge was thickening in the pan, not a pretty sight.  I used it correctly and it has been stored according to manufacturers direction.  It has a 5 year Limited Warranty for replacement.  I don't feel it's worth the trouble to send back as I don't want another of this brands products, ever.  It's going in the garbage as I attempt to find an accurate, well calibrated candy thermometer

Discount any review of a blender that reflects only several months of use.  As a smoothie addict, shoveling a dozen or more ice cubes into the jar daily, I'm still looking for a machine that can go the distance (is a full year's use asking too much?).  The Braun burned out in the first 90 days, faster than my Black and Decker, Oster, even Hamilton Beach (though it lasted longer than Back to the Basics).  The best thing I can say for the Braun is that it doesn't have the impossible-to-clean push buttons (always look for a single switch, a knob, or a touch-pad).  Otherwise, their shavers have served me better, mowing down whiskers more dependably than ice cubes.

This citrus juicer has a very good external design. The problem is that 30W is not enough power for doing the job well: normal orange presure stops de motor! The transmission of the power is done by cheap plasic parts, so they broke easily. These parts broke after a dozen of uses in my case, so I do not recommend this machine.

Fiestaware 1 qt pasta bowls....I got what I paid for!

<text>
<Text>
While seeing this pasta bowl on sale for $4.99 here at Amazon.com, I didn't think twice to purchase several of them will all kind of color availalbe 2 weeks ago. What a great price! I was so excited and waiting on the door on the schedule delivery day. The packing is nice and secure. The color was so vivid at the first sight, but.... after I took a hard look, almost half of the bowls are defective!! Un-colored white spot, un-glazed bubble holes, black dots/stain inside of the bowl. Even defective spots are tiny, but they are so obvious. They just don't look good with those flaws on them! I was so....disappointed and frustrated as I went through all the 21 bowls I ordered. By the way, the BLACK bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl. I will say those are probably the factory-secondary products. It turned out I have to return almost half of the bowls and keep those bowls with bearable defectiveness, such as vague stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls. Of course, all the black ones are returned since they are no-name with the bad quality. No one will even believe they are Fiestaware!!

Tired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice, I was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently.  No such luck with this one! First, it uses a different measuring system for the rice ("rice cooker cup")than it does for the water ("regular measuring cup"), so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it's back to guesswork again! Worse though, is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed, so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam. For those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great. One might figure out how to adjust the measuring, but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output. Since water boils at the same temperature, fast or slow, it makes no sense.

I hardly ever write reviews but I felt the need to on this item. I bought the senseo deluxe last night, I wanted the deluxe model so that I could also make tea. The setup was quick and easy and the price was great compared to the competition. Here's the problem, I brewed a cup of coffee and this was the weakest coffee EVER and I'm not even a big coffee drinker. To make matters worse each pod only makes 4oz of coffee. Who drinks only 4 ounces of anything. You would need to use 2 pods just to make 8 oz and then the coffee is still weak. Which is wear the waste of money comes in. The senseo pods are the same price as the home cafe pods but you will go through them twice as fast. I personally ended up returning this machine and getting a tassimo this morning. I originally bought the Senseo because I didnt want to spend Tassimo money but in the end you pay for what you get. Now the tassimo is great. I've made hot chocolate for my daughter and tea for my son. Everyone likes it. Good luck everyone.

I had a Black and Decker processor that I got as a wedding present over twenty years ago, and it never let me down once. When it was time to get a new one, I got this 1500 thinking that it's a B&D and I can't go wrong. Well as as soon as I tried to grate some cheese the plastic ring on the shredder/grater blade snapped off. The next time I used it a metal pin in the pastic cover that holds the blade securely broke the plastic groove it was in. Too bad B&D went down the drain through the years

I received my food processor for Christmas.  I had noticed the same processor at a different store that came with a bonus blade for fine shredding.  I decided to see if I could buy accessories for mine online.  I could not find any accessories or replacement parts for the Power Pro II.  I was concerned about the number of unfavorable reviews I came across during my search.  Despite the numerous negative comments concerning the motor going out, I decided to keep it.  I used it for the first time tonight to make a sauce and was only halfway finished when it stopped working!  I strongly recommend NOT purchasing this food processor

These dishes, first of all, are just beautiful.  The white looks so wonderful on the table and the presentation is just fabulous.  That said, be prepared to buy and buy and buy these if you like the looks of them. They break horribly easily and the cleanup, well, we just won't go there.  I've had mine for 10 years and now I'm down to just two of the serving pieces.  They break very easily in the oven, in the cabinet, you name it, it's gone.  If you're looking for a better one, go for the Le Creuset La Poterie line, or just grab a Longaberger one.  They're definitely worth it because you'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece.  I hate trying to clean these after using them so I just don't use them anymore for anything but to mix items.  That way, nothing gets baked on them and I am not breaking nails scouring off the mess.  I definitely recommend getting something else

Broken
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
We registered for this as a wedding gift and were disappointed to find the large dish shattered in both the first AND second box we picked up. It's a very attractive set; too bad it can't actually contain food due to broken corners, can't be washed in a dishwasher, can't be used on the stove, and can't be used to broil! You can't use the ramikin dishes for creme brulee, which is why I wanted them. Additionally, Target doesn't allow you to open the box in the store to check the merchandise. I realize most of the other reviews complain about the shattering too, but I just thought I'd point out that the Corningware doesn't have to be shipped to you to arrive broken

The blender part that holds the blade broke the second time I used it to crush ice. The food processor part works ok, but the major problem is it's extremely loud. It's beyond the pain level. It's so loud, I have to use hearing protection or my ears are ringing for 15 minutes afterwards. It's louder than my circular saw

Hard to clean
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
I picked this up recently and tried several varieties of loose tea in it.  The bottom line is that tea does get stuck in the one that I own.  I have tried a couple of methods to get the tea out to no avail.  It might be hard to see from the picture, but the "holes" for the water are actually slits in the bottom around the bottom rim of the infuser.  The slits are actually sickle shaped and the tea gets caught in the narrow areas.  I imaging that differences in the cuts would either make or break this product.  In my case they make me want to break it

I had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely. The rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter, even with daily cleaning. Sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night, very noisily, until I put a timer on it to turn off at night. It was very diffult to clean, even with daily inspection.

At first it looked like it was going to work great (when the litter was clean). After a day or so, it wasn't cleaning very well. I got better litter and it started working better, but still not great. Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake. After about two weeks of use, the rake stopped moving backwards. I tried to fix it, but it just won't go in reverse. Overall, this was a big waste of time and money. I'm not even going to try to get another one. A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean. It's too bad as it had a promising beginning. DO NOT BUY

I loved this bread machine, but it broke after owning it for about three years.  My husband took it apart to try to fix it, but could not repair it.  It was making bread and just turned off.  We could not get it to turn back on and the manual was not helpful in trying to fix such a problem.  We now have to replace it.  It worked great until it just stopped working.  I think a breadmaker should last longer then three years.  Also, I did need to make sure the ingredients in the corners of the pan got mixed into the dough, so I couldn't just program it and leave the house

20'Hose DOES NOT FIT HEPA Hoovers!!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The information on the pages that pertain to this hose needs to be changed to reflect the fact that the hose DOES NOT fit Hoovers with a HEPA system.  It only fits Hoovers with product #'s beginning U53.., U54.., U64..  I ordered it along with a new Windtunnel that has a Hepa system, since the product information stated that these 2 items were bought together by other people.  Unfortunately, it does not state that these people (now including me) have to return the hose because it does not fit all Windtunnels.  So be sure to check and doublecheck before you buy.  ..

disapointing for Cuisinart
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I use this rice cooker mostly for brown rice and it is a fiasco.  You need to put in 1/2 the water that you are supposed to, wait until that is cooked in and then add the other half.  Adding all the water up front causes the cooker to boil over - a real mess with rice.  It looks OK, but it just isn't the quality item you would expect with the name Cuisinart.  The price is also reasonable, so its not the end of the world - it might be better for things that don't require as much water or cook time (like white rice)

Burns rice even w/ more h20
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Bought one recently from a Mervyns sale.  Rice burned especially at the bottom (black & crunchy).  So I returned and got another one in case the 1st one was defective.  Nope, did the same thing.  So next go around, I added more water, but still the rice tasted funny- a burned taste- although the rice didn't burn as much this time.  For the cost and design, I was hoping this would be a great rice cooker.  Design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord, however, this cooker can't even perfom its main purpose- just plainly cook rice without burning it.  Yes, I did add enough water and followed instructions and used the measuring cup.  Hopefully they'll improve it.  Better yet, maybe Krups can design a better abd sleek-looking yet working rice cooker

I bought this in October, 2004 because I wanted something small for my kitchen.  You cannot cook over 2 cups of rice without it spurting out all over the cooker.  Now, it shuts off mid-way and I have to wait for it to cool down and try to reset it.  Hopefully the "powers that be" will read these comments and make improvements

I have many fond childhood memories of making and decorating sprtiz cookies with my mother. She had an old copper and stainless steel cookie press and it turned out perfect cookies almost everytime.

I have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best.  Only problem is that they RUST!!!  I had mine a few weeks when I noticed the rust spots on the interior.  I don't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot, so it must have happened simply because I leave water in my tea kettle at all times.  The directions that come with this kettle say not to do so, but any serious tea drinker like me knows that's unrealistic.

I would recommend buying a KING set for a full bed. This was my first experience with cotton jersey sheets so I didn't know what to expect but I wouldn't buy them again

In theory, this is a good machine.  It did, in fact, work as advertised for a brief time - then it started to smell.  All of the urine, drinks, vomit, whatever nasty stuff you just vaccumed up from your carpet, starts to pool under the holding tank.  As it festers there, the exhaust fan takes that wonderful aroma and blows it all over your house.  This, to an extent, is simply a nuisance - bad smell and extra clean-up of the machine itself - until it starts leaking all of that crap back into your carpet, making more mess than you started with.  The first time this happened, Bissell customer service sent a replacement unit.  We started having the same problems with it shortly after we received it.  Bissell only wants to send us another (no doubt defective) unit - so unless you want to be stuck with a stinky, urine-leaking, mess-maker, don't buy this product !

We purchased the Cuisinart SmartPower blender for smoothies and light duty blending duties.  It's a nicely designed unit , very stable on the countertop, but very poor quality gear drive.  After a couple dozen uses, the motor gear wheel broke, apparently a common problem on these Cuisinarts, as noted by other reviewers.  Cuisinart customer service is worthless - it costs more to ship and repair the unit than to replace it.

AirBake products are horrible! I have used the cookie sheets multiple times and I have had nothing but problems. There products over-brown everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans. I have better luck using my old cheap non-stick bakeware than AirBake. Buyer beware! If you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature

I used this press about 4-5 times during the 5 years I owned it.  The cookie shapes came out well, but after a few uses, the plastic ring around the barrel cracked.  This year that same plastic part broke entirely, making the press unusable-- a critical engineering materials defect.  Like the other reviewer (Dec 2005), I too am now in the market for an all metal press

I have had these dishes for only 1 year and they have ALL chipped and cracked and the glaze is cracked as well.  I have re-ordered a set of bowls and several plates and had the same results.

I am SO disappointed and am now shopping for a new set of dishes

If you plan to use it then you are wasting your money.  Someone should be ashamed

Cute, but useless

</title>
<text>
<Text>
This item is metal and looks like an old fashioned ice crusher, but it is so small that it is useless. Its only 9 inches tall, so if you are expecting a nice big heavy duty machine, forget it. I bought it because I missed the ice in the door of my old fridge, but after trying it several times, I sent it back. It is so small that you rap your knuckles on the counter. I dont think there is a glass made that is small enough to fit in it, so you have to use the little tin cup that comes with it. I takes about three loads of ice to fill the cup, and about 2 cups to fill a glass. You need 4 hands to operate it: 1 to hold the lid, 1to turn the crank,1to keep it from bouncing all over the place, and 1 to hold the little tin cup in place  (it slides out and then the ice lands on the base). Then when you finally get a cup fulll of ice, you have to try to get it out of the tin cup and into your glass. I broke the glass the first time i tried it. It hass little rubber feet that fall out and disapear, making it even more wobbly. But as I said in the begging, it IS cute

poor shipping, damaged pieces
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
the furniture itself is fine. or rather, it would be if it was shipped properly. before ordering anything from target, think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return. if you receive something damaged (and you will), be prepared for an extensive return process. chances are, the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well. this happened to me twice. if you're lucky, you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments. this, however, will take time. additionally, even if the piece is not cracked, you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood. i bought the desk, the hutch and the bookcase - all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain.

Bad Candy Thermometer
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The only positive thing I can say about this candy thermometer is that the design allows it to stay on the sauce pan relatively well.  Other than that, it is difficult to discern temperatures between the 0 - 50 marks.  Also, it tends to read low so that the candy is much warmer than the read out indicates.  Since using this thermometer, I have ruined more batches of fudge than I care to think about.  If you want a good candy thermometer, don't buy this one.

I have always used Rubbermaid or Tupperware plastic storage, but I replaced all of them with Pyrex glass storage containers in May of 2005.

Also, I liked the idea that glass does not stain and it gives a clear presentation of stored food in the refrigerator--making leftovers more likely to be eaten before they go bad.

The rating I give this item relates to the lack of value.  In a few more clicks, you can buy a service-for-eight of white corelle for less than what three of these dinner plates will cost you. That said, I have owned my Corelle (two services-for-four) for more than twenty-five years, using it regularly.  All dishes are intact, they are light and stack nicely, and maybe I'm just not enough of a snob but I don't know why anyone would need any other dishes

I have used Pyrex bakeware for over 20 years, and I was shocked when my fairly new 9x13 pan shattered.  I figured I just got unlucky and got a bad one.  I was going to buy a new one - thank goodness I read the reviews first!  And yes, I did follow instructions - I baked my lasagne at 350 degrees, did not use an open flame or broiler, etc etc.  I can't believe this safety hazard is still allowed to be sold!  I am so mad!  I am switching to Corningware now

Another victim of exploding pyrex
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Well Im the newest victim of exploding pyrex.  Last night I was cooking some salmon in my 3-quart pyrex that I've had for 3 years and used many times before.  It was in my oven at 400 for only 25 minutes.  I pulled it out and set it on the counter.  Well I leaned in to check the salmon and as I pulled away the glass exploded! Not just broke but a full on explosion of glass flying everywhere.  Thankfully I pulled away when I did because if I had pulled away 2 seconds later I would have had a face full of Pyrex shrapnel. I came away with only a few small cuts on my stomach...and from what I've heard I was lucky.  Even though my boyfriend and I swept and vacumed our kitchen last night there was so much glass that in the morning light I could still see little pieces of glass all over the kitchen.  Im not taking any chances, Im throwing out my other Pyrex dishes and switching to all aluminum trays.  Please DO NOT USE PYREX! It is not worth the risk! You may have a few years of good use, but is it worth risking your safety or that of your children?

Exploding Pyrex
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have been a chef now for seven years and have not ever had a problem with pyrex.  Until now.  Last night while roasting some potatoes in a 400F oven, my pyrex dish exploded.  It rained glass all over the inside of my oven.  It was a disaster.  I am just thankful that nothing happened to me or my two year old who was in the room at that time.  This sounds like a REAL PROBLEM!

Great coffee but too easy to break
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after I figured out how to make it work, loved it. After a while the latch on the top broke off and I had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee. That made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down. It was a little inconvenient but I got use to it. Then the metal filter broke and I decided to get a new one. Luckily I put the old one in the garage for "spare parts" because not long after I started using the new one the side tab broke off and I had to grab a replacement off the old one. I will probably not purchase this brand again

VERY disappointing
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I owned a Rival crockpot for 20 years and was very happy with it.  When it stopped working I therefore bought another (this one) from Rival.  I've used it twice.  The top doesn't seem to keep the liquid in, even on low, and it burned the food both times.  I don't trust it now and am not sure whether I'll try it again.

Faulty lid on Rival 33511 5 Quart CrockPot Slow Cooker
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought this because it was well priced, good sized and looked better than many other slow cookers. I assumed it would work as well as my 10 year old slow cooker that I gave away. The first time I used it (as soon as it got up to tempurature) the lid started to rumble and slip around the top. Then came the spitting hot water and steam that went in my toaster down the side of the cooker and on the counter. The lid is the worst! At first I thought maybe I was missing a rubber seal or something on my lid. Now I realize this is the way it was designed! I made a pork roast in it which usually works great but in this slow cooker it seemed to cook quicker with no liquid left because it evaporated through the faulty lid. The only way to correct the spitting water and the rumbly,tumbly,bouncy lid is to put a paper towel under part of the lid but even this eventually fails because the towel gets soaked and then starts to drip on the counter. Not to mention its probably a fire hazard. I don't think my paper towel idea is what Rival had in mind when they designed this! I wish I could return this but I threw away the receipt.

I really thought I would like this product when I got it out of the box.  It's looks well made and looked easy to use.  I followed instructions and cleaned it throughly and put my recipe misture and miniture sausages in it to slowly heat and to use as an appetizer.  I put the the heat setting on warm as I was not in a hurry and I left the room for about 5 minutes.  When I came back there was mixture all over my cabinets, counters, etc. and what was left was boiling and sputtering like mad.  I later found out that no matter what heat setting I used it would over heat.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone I'm sorry to say

Consumer Reports got this one wrong!

Like many others, I bought this because it came highly recommended by Consumer Reports.  It worked great for a while, but after about a year the brush stopped spinning.  I replaced the belt (twice!) but it still won't work.  If I didn't read about so many others having similar problems, I would have guessed that I just got a bad vacuum - but after reading other reviews here at Amazon, I see that this is not a model that anyone should buy, despite the high rating from Consumer Reports

The tea press works fine if you are planning on serving a crowd.  For one or two people, it simply doesn't work.  You must add an enormous amount of tea for the press to work properly.  I once had a smaller tea press, and I thought that was what I was purchasing here.

I really like OXO products.  I have a number of their utensils in my kitchen and I enjoy that they have nice big handles.  Since I started getting gadgets for my kitchen I always wanted these measuring cups.  Well I finally got them.  I was very excited to use them for the first time.  Well I went to scoop some brown sugar and the handle started bending.  I was very disappointed in how flimsy the handles are.  I think I'll stick to my plastic ones from OXO, I had better luck with them

Not The Best At All

I have been making ice cream in a Cuisinart machine for years but I wanted to regain my freezer space from the 2 canisters I had to keep ready.. I also wanted to make good gelato since I can't go to Italy all the time. I had first bought the Lussino 4080 by Musso. It was terrible. Too soft right out of the machine and full of ice crystals when put in the freezer for any amount of time. It didn't get firm, it became a rock. I returned it and got the Lello Gelato Pro instead.  It is quieter, has a washable bowl, costs about half the money, weighs much less and makes 2 quarts rather than 1&1/2 quarts. There is no contest. The Lello is the superior machine

The old OXO tea kettles had a train whistle sound.   This new one has a single high pitch whistle that is so weak you couldn't hear it in the next room.  Save your money and buy something cheaper.  It will work as well if not better.  I returned mine and got another brand and it works just fine and it was cheaper too.

Cork Screw Failure
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Unlike the other reviewers, my Kitchenaid cork screw worked fine for almost two years. It never quite pulled the cork far enough out of the bottle to suit me -- it didn't make cork pulling labor-free -- but I found it much easier than any previous such tool I ever owned. Alas, as in many of the other reviews, the screw finally broke off in a cork and the device seems irreparable. A cheap plastic cork screw had to be called into service. I just visited the Kitchenaid web page and they don't offer a cork screw for sale anymore. I presume that I will soon toss mine as well. Planning to buy one of these for $30? Clint would ask you: Do you feel lucky

I, too, bought this terrible piece of equipment. My complaint, aside from the odd taste, consistency and smell, was that you could not tell when the egg was done. It was still raw at 10 minutes. By the time it was cooked you could have used it for a nerf ball. What a waste of money. As far as thinking up other purposes for it, I suppose it could be a sacrificial camping outdoor firepit cook pan for something.  You'll have to think of something, just don't put eggs in it

its just a simple plastic tube that fits on the end of the grinder attachment so you can stuff sausage. So how did they manage to mess this one up? The flare at the wide end of the horn does not sit flat against the head of the grinder, so when you go to tighten the ring down to hold it into place, the collar can not screw on all the way. The result? A build up of meat in the front part of the collar. This eventually begins to drip down making a bloody mess of whatever is under the grinder attachment. How hard would it have been for Kitchenaid to design the horn so it fitted flat in place and the collar would have screwed on tight?

To be fair, the design is great looking, size is ideal, and very functional.  However, beware of quality and packaging.  Whoever packaged this in Thailand did not take care, it has nicks and scratches everywhere..not to mention the dings in corners.  Paint in all the panels is inconsistent..therefore, you can see different colorations throughout different panels.  It is somewhat redish in stain tone, could be darker to be a true dark walnut.  Manufacturing flaws such as missing drill holes, which makes it tough when assembling...got screws, just missing screw holes.  I only recommend to those with a nack of wood handyman, not for the average person.  Recommend you need the following tools: Drill with phillips screw heads and drill bits(just in case), small bottle of dark wood stain(to touch up painting the scratches), and some patience.

Regardless of the setting you use, you will get half coffee powder and half coarse grounds.  In addition, the feature that is intended to allow you to control the amount of grounds you make with a switch on the top ... does not work.  Be prepared to grind more than you need, and then measure the grounds (somehow avoiding the powder) yourself.

I bought this thinking I would be able to regulate the size, (I have had my other coffee grinder for 10 yr. still works), to say it is loud is an understatement, & 1st thing in the AM.  I had it about 2 weeks, when I noticed it was hot to the touch, and it no longer worked, mind you I had not used it in 2 days, and had moved it to clean.  I have not contacted them at this point, but do not want a replacement, and a part of me is glad it broke, so I don't have to listen to the noise anymore

I ordered the My Cafe from Amazon in early October and received it a few days later. On initial set-up, the unit failed to prime. I talked to Bunn's Service Dept. and was coached to try several steps, which did not work. I was given a return authorization number and told that I would be sent a brand new machine once they received the defective one. I have Fed Ex verification that the My Cafe was received by Bunn on October 18. I called Bunn on November 6 and was told that they would check on my replacement and call me back in a couple on minutes. No return call came. I called again on November 9th and was told that the My Cafe has been on back order and that I am in line with an unknown other number of customers awaiting shipment. They could not, or would not, give me any meaningful information on when I might expect to see if the replacement works any better than the original. My Cafe may be a great machine but Bunn's service is atrocious

I got the machine yesterday and was so excited. I got it all ready to prime by following the directions, and it didn't work. After several attempts I called Bunn customer service thinking that I must be doing something wrong. When I talked to the customer service rep. he told me that the machine wasn't pumping hot water into the reservoir and that this was a common problem with the machine. I'm thinking for $200.00 this isn't right, and why hasn't the company fixed it? He was very nonchalant about it as if it didn't matter; just get a new one. This just isn't acceptable to me. There are many positive reviews so I'm sure if you get a working one than you'll probably be happy with it. As for me, I refuse to use something that has a known problem that the company isn't even trying to remedy. Therefore, I'm sending it back to Amazon for a full refund and buying the Simple Human coffee maker which has gotten great reviews

Great Frother - espresso consistently inconsistent
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The frother is great!  Easy to use etc.  The espresso temperature is 140 degrees F when measuring the stream of coffee coming from the machine after the machine has warmed up for 6 minutes.  At that LOW temperature you can't extract the flavors and aroma required for a great cup of espresso.  Other reviews stating it can take 5 minutes to brew a cup of espresso are accurate.  This occurs when the grind is too fine.  I've had this machine for over a year and it is NOT recommended. I use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine.  To add insult to injury, the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap.  I thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble.  Previously I had a Gaggia which is superior in every manner, and cheaper also.  The only reason I rated it 2 stars is because of the frother.

finicky machine has a real design problem
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought the Capresso 114 last December (the difference being, the model 112 has chrome trim and a very questionable milk reservoir). This machine is unbelievably finicky; you must use an extremely coarse grind (according to the manual), and almost zero tamping pressure (again, according to the manual), otherwise you get unbelievably slow coffee flow (several minutes for a shot of espresso). Even when you get everything according to instructions (which includes, according to Capresso tech support, disassembling the machine every few days), it takes at least 5 minutes to pour a shot of espresso, which comes out weak, bitter, and with no crema. After two months of discussing this with Capresso tech support and getting nowhere, I returned the machine to Amazon. After that I bought a Krups XP 4000 -- bliss! The machine makes great espresso in about 25 seconds, even with a fine grind and firm tamp.

Poor quality coffee
</Text>

<text>
<Text>
This machine is sure to disappoint a seasoned European-style coffee drinker (coffee as in beverage made from coffee bean, not a tall cup of Sanka as the term is used in the US). Admittedly, I'm really picky about my coffee, but $250 for this machine is ridiculous. I've had coffee from a $40 Krups machine that is better than that made by the EspressoPro. I use high-quality pods with this machine (Molinari, Lucaffe, and Miscela d'Oro) which guarantees consistency in other machines, but doesn't help with this machine. Here are my issues with the machine.

I too have experienced the water tank caving in and not working properly if you forget to take the water tank out of the steamer unit, and mind you, you must also remove the cap from the water reservoir even after you remove it from the steamer.  I have tried putting hot water in the tank in an attempt to regain its original shape to no avail.  I would not recommend buying this steamer for this reason

Leaks coffee while brewing 8 out of 10 times
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
As another reviewer experienced, our Krups also leaks coffee all over the counter and subsequently the floor quite often, which is apparently related to having to have the carafe situated in just exactly the right place within a half a millimeter, and which place I have not yet discovered except occasionally by chance.  Carafe positioning appears to be the problem, because it doesn't leak every time.  Maybe my unit is defective, because other reviewers don't mention this, and believe me, you would notice this if it were occurring with yours.

I had slightly older edition of the Krups Crystal Aroma for several years, until I lost one carafe too many - if you're careless, when empty they tend to roll like a bowling ball right off the countertop.  But that's my fault.  The Crystal Aroma carafe looks cool and the filter would probably help if you have unpleasant tap water, but overall, the quality of the coffee it produces is merely OK.

I ordered the Pro 5 Plus three times and recieved the wrong one 3 times.  They kept sending the "Commercial 5 mixer."  In the meantime I have accumulated 2 shoping bags full of baking goods.  I have ordered many  "cookie" art books, along with many supplies as well as the Set of 3 Pasta Maker attachment for this mixer.  This has been going on since the beginning of December.  But no mixer!

My first Cuisinart 4-slice toaster developed a dangerous problem after the 3-month warantee period: it started heating when not turned on, and made strange clicking sounds.  It never had toasted very well, and only toasted lightly on the darkest setting.  To their great credit, Cuisinart replaced the toaster for the shipping cost alone (although it took 3 months). The replacement toaster also toasts very lightly, very slowly, but at least it's not an immediate fire hazard

Brass rivets expand and contract. Wood expands and contracts. Together these elements are a bad concept from the word "go", because they will ultimately separate because someone will at one time or another put them in the dishwasher. The metal is only tempered 4 times leaving the metal soft, meaning there is a lot of sharpeing to do. Henckel, cutco, trident are expensive and chefs all over the world use them because the are used everyday and they retain their sharpness because they are tempered 7 times (the maximum amount before metal becomes so hard that it becomes brittle)

High hopes but doesn't work for kitty litter
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I had bought this vacuum because of the good reviews.  I wanted a cordless vac to take care of the quick jobs -- not heavy cleaning -- but the primary job was to do to take care of daily kitty litter cleanup (rescued mother cat and 4 kittens).  It does a good job for lint and hair but doesn't work on kitty litter.  It spits it around or keeps in roller section.  I thought I was using it wrong and tried it every way -- but it only picks up a small percentage of the kitty litter and rest is just blown around or drops out when it's turned off.  I'm going to have to buy another cordless vaccum

I bought this product about a year ago and for a while it worked great. Then I noticed that the unit was starting to shut off faster and faster until today when I finally decieded to toss her. Overall in the beginning yes there is alot of power but what is the good of it when the battery's life is only about a year before she goes. I wouldnt recommend one especially since Dirt Devil came out with a cyclone one which I will try with hopefully longer lasting results.

Easily the worst toaster ever.  Brendaa the 5 star above must have gotten the single toaster in the whole production series that actually worked.  There are just not enough words in the English Language to describe this utterly useless peice of junk that will not hold toast down etc. etc..  Well, maybe not useless, if you are looking for something to bring about a cathartic welling of emotions that has you standing in the yard with a maul and and a toaster at your feet.  I'd give it a minus 5 stars, but they do not even have a 0 star vote

This pricey toaster is not worth its weight in bread.  For the first few weeks it seemed to evenly brown the bread but since then it has become the worst toaster I have ever owned.  It is impossible to get evenly browned bread instead you get burnt crust and blotches of brown randomly scattered over the bread.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT

Stop Be For You Buy!!!!  Should have saved my money.  Making pasta with this machine is disappointing.  The recipe given with the instructions is way to sticky to run through the extruder.  I redid the dough 3 times before I was able to extrude it, and still it stuck together.  I should have listened to the rest of the reviews, but having owned a pasta maker/extruder before I thought it would be a piece of cake.  If I were you I would invest in the roller pasta maker for you mixer.  On the bright side though...The food grinder is wonderful

I have not tried this pasta attachment a second time - I'm afraid of harming the motor.  The mixer became VERY hot and oil even leaked out.  I going to get the mixer checked/serviced and not risk damage again. One thing missing from these reviews is the mixer models used. Perhaps those with the heavier motors work better?  I have the smaller motor (250 W) K45SS mixer.  Surely KitcheAid must read these reviews. I would expect some additional user information for this product on their website, but see nothing. Very disappointing product and consumer support.  Come on KitchenAid - give more info and/or offer to give $$ credit for return of this questionable product

I've purchased several different rotary graters and this one had the same result as many of it's other plastic siblings.  It too broke within 2 days of use.  These plastic graters just aren't built with much strength and should not be used with harder cheeses, or by someone who has a strong grip.  The common defect I'm finding in plastic graters is how the rotating arm is attached to the drum.  The tiny amount of plastic there isn't desined to withstand shearing forces which is what rotates the drum.

I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mother.  I was very excited when it arrived much sooner than I had anticipated.  I opened it up, so that I could give it to my mom assembled.  Unfortunately, an entire corner was broken off and the other corner was cracking and splintering.  The packing materials are insufficient to say the least.  I immediately called target's customer service, and the operator very graciously assisted me in returning my table.  Despite my dissapointment about the broken table I was glad that Target did the best they could to resolve my issue without any hassle.  &#60;br /&#62;

It looked like a great Idea, just what I needed to get my older golden in and out of my jeep.  Problem is, there is a serious crush hazard because of the weight and design.  There is a finger &quot;crush area&quot; near the hinges where a user would most likely grasp the ramp to fold it. I have mashed fingers several times and sustained a moderately serious crushed finger the last time I used it.  If I can't make it safe with a saw, then out it goes.  It's too dangerous for anyone in my family to use

When I bought my first LitterMaid box, I thought it was a miracle -- no more scooping! Hooray! It worked so well for my four cats that a few months later, I bought a second one. Unfortunately, the second box quit working after just a couple of weeks (and I'd thrown the receipt away, so I couldn't get my money back). Soon after that, the original box quit working, too. So, within about 6 months, I spent close to $200 on electric boxes that no longer functioned.

The Littermaid Mega is absolutely one of the worst purchases I have ever made.  In less than two months time, the unsubstantial motor has burned out completely.  Litter Maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat.  Well, I have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily.  The Litter Maid is good for controlling odors when it works, but it constantly jammed and then shut down (and I used a recommended brand of premium cat litter).  After a few weeks of this load, the tiny (and very loud) motor simply gave up.  I'm waiting to hear from Litter Maid regarding warranty repair/replacement, but I suspect I'll end up returning to a traditional $5.00 litter tray.  The overall concept of the Litter Maid is good, but without sturdier components, it ends up being trash in no time

I VERY MUCH ENJOYED THIS UNIT WHEN IT WAS NEW IT DID EVERYTHING THAT WAS STATED ON THE BOX.However, I now need to replace the IFD filter due to the accumulation of nicotene on it and can not find one anywhere. I purchased two units at once for around $450.00.If I had used them in a "dust" atmosphere they would still be great! Honeywell should have tested on Nicotene and smoke odors before touting the phrase permanent in reference to smoke and nicotene. I am sadly disappointed in a company, who over the years, I have purchased many of their products

I should have returned it but I was mad at it and trashed it.. at least it was marked 15% off (still higher than here though).

I have purchased these plates from Amazon in the past and the earlier plates were made in England.

I will say that had I not already had the more detailed & colorful items, I might have appreciated these of lesser quality more than I did.

Poorly designed lid
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is a gorgeous ice bucket. It is large and stylish.  However, I cannot recommend it because of the lid.  The lid is attached to the bucket and does not come completely off.  Instead, it pivots and swings up.  The problem with this is that you cannot fill the bucket all the way up with ice because you have to leave a good amount of room at the top for the lid to swing.  And, because the lid is not removable, it gets in the way especially if you want to use this bucket as a champagne/wine cooler.  Poor design flaw.  I want an ice bucket that I can remove the lid and put it aside if I don't need to use it rather than having it sticking up and in the way. You'll notice in OXO's main picture of this bucket on this site it is shown without the lid sticking up.  Why?  Because it makes for a cleaner look not having the lid in the way.  Hey OXO, that's the same look I wanted this bucket to have sitting on my bar!

I have a Profesional 6 model, and I did everything the recipe said for 1 batch of regular spaghetti pasta.  It didn't kill the mixer, but the motor became very hot!  I will never use it again.  I also have the roto slicer/shredder, fruit/veggie strainer, food grinder & sausage stuffer attachments...none of these have even made my stand mixer very warm.  --That tells me the pasta maker attachment is a bad product.  I am thankful that my model is 525 watts...I could only imagine what would have happened if I had a classic 300 watt model!

Have been wanting to get the pasta roller attachment and ran accross this plastic pasta maker at the store.  Was really excited since it was in my price range.  Took it home and tried to use it.  My KitchenAid mixer starting smoking and so I let it rest for the hour.  Upon removing the attachment I found oil and black rubber or grease was all over the inside of the attachment. (on the coil thing that pushes the dough through) Next time I wanted to use my mixer to beat egg whites it had no power.  I sure hope this inexpensive attachment didn't ruin my wonderful mixer.  Highly disappointed with KitchenAid on this attachment

If you buy this this thing, be prepared to cut off about an inch off the tip, 'cause apparently the tip is just there for aesthetics. Plunging this thermometer into boiling water, it won't read accurately (15-20deg under) until at least an inch of the tip is immersed

Another Dissapointed Cuisinart customer!

I purchased a 14-cup Cuisinart some years ago.  I have had nothing but trouble.  First the handle stuck while I was kneading dough and I barely was able to pry it off.  Then I had problems with the stem.  When I tried to get a new one from customer service they told me that they were no longer servicing my older model and suggested I buy a new Cuisinart!  Stay away from Cuisinart!  I'm looking into Kitchen Aid for my new processor

Beware, outer shell, may melt!!!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I recently purchased this product.  The first time I used it, I thought it worked great.  I made a pot of chili and let it cook until we were ready to eat it that night.  The second time I used it, things were not as good.  The outer shell where the controls are were literally melting.  I had programmed this to cook for 10 hours while I went to work.  I came home that night and the hours had not changed. I realized I didn't click the on/off button to start heating the cooker.  This may have saved a house fire.  I went ahead and changed the time from 10 to 4 hours.  This set the unit to high instead of the original low setting.  Not 15 minutes after turning on, the outer covering was melting.  I immediately shut it off.  I see the 4 quart units were recalled back in 2004 for similar issues.  Whatever their problem, it has not been fixed.  Be aware of this serious problem when using your slow cooker.  I am returning mine and will exchange for a different brand

These silicone pot holders are indeed brightly colored, easy to wash in the dishwasher, and protective even when wet.  They are also clumsily stiff at the same time as they are slippery, the net result being a miserable failure in the kitchen.  They are useful for protecting a counter from a hot pot, but not for picking the hot pot up

This is our second George F grill.  The first one burned out after about 5 years.  We liked but could not get the same size so we got this one.  It was bigger than we wanted but we had no other choices.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!  After less than one year and not heavy use the connector to the thermostat (spade conn.) just fell apart.  Being the handy man that I am, I fixed it.  Today (9/6/2005) it burned out again.  This grill is a fire hazard and should be recalled.  It is a piece of junk.  We will replace it with a different brand.  Thanks for nothing George

Apparently the set I ordered was out of stock, but vision decour neglected to update their web site. After they contacted me about this issue I checked their site and they still had the set listed as availabel and in stock. So now I have been waiting for weeks and have half of a living room with no prospect of getting the table set I needed to match everything else

My first and only use was to cook a roast in the oven at 275 degrees and within the first 30 minutes it started to give me the wrong readings.  I have had it a while but have not used it as it is only good for the oven. The statement on the inside instructions "WHEN COOKING IN A BARBECUE OR SMOKER, DO NOT USE AS A CONTINUOUS READ THERMOMETER, USE ONLY AS AN INSTANT READ THERMOMETER.", "5. DO NOT USE THIS UNIT TO MEASURE COOKING TEMPERATURES OVER 392&#9702;F." as well as "WARRANTY EXCLUDES THERMOMETER PROBES." should be on the outside, letting people know this is only for the oven for continuous use and that the probes are junk.  If you have to keep checking the meat in a smoker over many hours, a cheap $6.00 meat thermometer will work just fine other than letting out the heat.  Why does the outside packaging say the reading range is 86&#9702; to 572&#9702; if you can only use to 392&#9702;.  I would say this is only a typo and they likely did a cut and paste on their lower temperature unit's instructions, but 275&#9702; in the oven killed mine so maybe not?  Cut to the chase, look for a better unit and let me know when you find it

This unit looks like it would be fun for the kids, but in fact, it barely works. Even when the insert is pre-frozen in a zero degree freezer, the maching has problems getting the mix even into a "soft" state, and even when it gets close to that, the ice cream does not dispense in a manner that allows for the classic soft-serve look in the cone. An email to cuisinart regarding the problem went unanswered. We used it twice, and gave up. One hint that's not in the instructions: you have to keep the machine running while dispensing -- or trying to dispense -- the ice cream. Another hint that's not in the instructions: don't buy this item

The ice cream did not harden enough until about 25 minutes;kids cannot wait that long.We could of driven to the local ice cream store and back by this time. Save your money,buy a old fashion ice cream maker instead at least your kids will get a workout and be occupied at the same time

Your freezer needs to at least zero degrees F in order to have the bowl freeze to a point the ice cream comes out a consistency thicker than a very thin milk shake. I needed a seperate chest freezer in order to achieve these temps.

That's right.  I got taken twice.  I bought this cooker for under $20 a few years ago, and it died after the second use.  Considering it was so inexpensive, I just bought another one.  It died again after only one use.  I wish I would have read the reviews beforehand because it seems to be a common problem.  I guess Salton just recycle their returns so they can afford to pay George Foreman the $90 million they owe him for endorsements

I have a set of mid-range Henckels that I bought some years ago, and they are -much- better than this.  I bought this set for my daughter because they were a good compromise between quality and price, and she won't ruin then in the dishwasher.  I would have thought that Henckels wouldn't make any actual crap, but this set comes awfully close.  The good thing is, boy are they sharp.  But there's bad things too.  Only the 8" chef's knife and the shears have any feel of quality at all, the rest are -very- thin and flimsy.  'Laser-cut' edges are overrated - make them another millimeter thick please, so they can make a precise cut without the blade bending and taking off in an unintended direction. A good knife is an extension of the cook's intention - it does what you want, and does NOT require thought and pre-conception and compensation in every cut. (...)is waaay too much for one adequate chef's knife and some toys.  Very disappointed in Henckels, and in Amazon too, I don't feel I got what I ordered.

<text>
<Text>
I myself am not a coffee drinker but after watching the lengths that my husband has gone through to get keep his coffee hot, I will agree with other reviewers, this Delonghi is Dewrongi. My husband has to boil the water in a kettle to pre-heat the carafe before brewing. If he doesn't get a chance to drink it right away, he puts the carafe (filled with coffee) onto the stovetop on low.  Well a couple mornings ago, we were both rushing around to get the kids off to school and off to work. Without thinking, he put the carafe on the burner but must have accidentally cranked it to high heat. Next thing I know I'm screaming from the kitchen because the carafe is on fire with 2 foot flames quickly spreading. He dumped a pot of cold water on it and hallelujah, no damage was done. (We are so lucky as we are selling our home in a few months.

I went to Amazon after having several problems with this coffee maker only to find lots of others with the same problems.  Yes, deLonghi makes a great product.  No, this is not one of them.  I have read the directions so often I have them memorized, and I can tell from the number of reviews that there is a serious quality control problem with this unit.  I bought mine from Costco, and sometimes the manufacturers do something different for Costco product runs.  I hope that is not the problem, but that is all I can think of that would be causing such a disparity of reviews.  So...who else bought this unit from Costco?  Because if that is the problem I'll bet Costco will be all over deLonghi to fix it.  Until then, this is definitely not the coffee maker you will look forward to first thing in the morning, every day

My Mom bought me this set for my anniversary two years ago.  We use it regularly and run it through the dishwasher and it is just horrible looking.  It spots and marks pitifully.  I can't get most of the spots off no matter what I do.  I wrote the company to complain and they said they would replace it if I mailed it in, but with the weight of the set (because it really is a heavy-duty set of flatware) it would have cost me a fortune to ship it to them and then all I would have gotten in return was another set of flatware that would probably look the same way in a short period of time.  So, I am just putting my experience out there to help others make an informed decision

Krups: Quality Control Issues?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Hi, I usually don't complain about the products that I buy because I consider myself a savvy consumer, but in this instance I was dubbed big time! A few years ago, we received a  Krups coffee maker as a wedding gift and we love it! However, this particular toaster rarely worked. In fact, I would say that 85% time it would either not toast or would "flip" the toast prematurely e.g. 5 second or less. I have no idea if this is a  fluck in quality control or not, but I highly recommend buying a  different toaster. I know, I thought, Krups makes a toaster? Wow, I'll buy it, after all how hard can it be for a German company to manufacture functional a toaster? Well, evidently, they have issues.

Although Consumer Reports rated this model as #2, I have found this a very disappointing purchase. The cheap aluminum parts inside bend all the time jamming the toaster. It toasts very uneavenly and inconsistently. I am very sorry I purchased this toaster. I was expecting much more from a toaster so highly rated but I've learned that Consumer Reports does not always get everything right. Listen to the other warnings and stay away from this toaster. As soon as I find another toaster, this one goes off to Goodwill.

I have had this gadget for a little over a year as we got it as a wedding gift.  I had not used it as it did not seem worth the trouble to plan on getting it out ahead of time and charging it for 15 hours when I could use a manual grater right when I needed it.  Last week, I needed to shred some cheddar for a recipe.  I read the instructions front to back, allowed it to charge the full amount of time, and I was pretty excited when it came time to try it out.  Right from the start, I knew it was junk.  You are supposed to be able to lift the piece of plastic up and have it stay in the up position while you change the blade.  Not mine.  The plastic piece kept coming off, and dozens of tries to keep it upright resulted in dozens of failures.  I decided to look past that and judge purely on the shredding ability.  Once I started trying to grate, I had a really hard time getting the thing to shred.  I tried varying degrees of pressure.  As others commented, the cheese does get stuck EVERYWHERE.  Then, the cheese that does come out is in tiny little shreds.  I did not get the nice big shreds that I am used to with my manual grater.  My husband thought I was doing it wrong, so he tried it.  He had the same result.  I will not even sell this at a rummage sale or give it to goodwill, because people are better off without it.  Since it was a gift, I'm glad I'm not out any money.  It is going in the trash

To whom it may concern.  Cheap assembly, binds up on internal hardwear, does not press fully, all in all, very poor product.  You would be better off hand squeezing with you hand than you would with this item...Run

After a couple of years of casual use, my bowl also cracked in the freezer. Fortunately I had it wrapped in a plastic bag so the mess was kept to a minimum. Now I'm in the market for one with a higher quality bowl.

I received this as a gift for Christmas. It worked like a charm for ice cream and lemon slush 3 times. BUT then, the base burst in my freezer, spewing foul scented goo all over. I contacted the manufacturer to ask how to get it replaced, and NEVER HEARD BACK. Apparently they don't care about backing up their product. Now I have to buy another one, and it won't be this brand

Horrible tasting ice cream that costs more than premium
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought this item on sale at Shopko, where it will be returned today.  I froze the gel disk as instructed, bought all the ingredients listed in the recipe booklet for vanilla ice cream, cooled the ingredients after mixing as instructed.  After 45 minutes of mixing I ended up with ice cream soup. You could let this thing run forever and never end up with ice cream that is set up enough to eat.  I put it in a container in the freezer.  The next morning I had an ice cream brick.  Not to be deterred I microwaved it for 15 seconds until it was soft enough to actually remove with my metal ice cream scoop.  This stuff gets harder than cement!  After all this work the ice cream had a bad plastic-like aftertaste.  I had to throw it all out.

What a Disappointment
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I used this maybe a dozen times before I stopped using it out of disgust. The surface is fragile and hard to clean. I reheated pizza and the residue stuck so tightly it could only be scraped off with extreme care. I did a bone-in slow roast and the weight alone pierced the surface so the juices bled into the matting layer. What's the point if you can't clean it or let anything harder than Jell-O come into contact with it.

Boils fast but this is a flawed kettle
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst.

The handles, although very cushioned, are TOO fat for my hands (which admittedly are rather small). I never really got to give either piece a true test though, because the blades on the parer and the vegetable peeler were way too dull to work well. I can't really recommend either, although the parer was a little better than the peeler

I bought this flatware in spite of the warnings about rust.  Well, sure enough, rust started to form on the knives just after the first run through the dishwasher.  The rust spots were small, but I returned the set anyways, as I am not willing to risk the severe rust problems reported by others.

I needed a compact cleaner to tidy up after my delightful cat decided to soil my couch.

<Text>
The first, and only time, I tried to use this compact carpet cleaner was a total disaster. While removing an old sofa to make way for new furniture, the delivery men stained the new carpet. I whipped out our new Atlantis, filled the rinse tank and popped in the soap cartridge. With manual in hand, I tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs... The unit did not dispense soapy water, the hand-held wand leaked, and finally I discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet, creating a soggy new stain. So here I am with two stains on my now very wet carpet, furniture being delivered and an Atlantis unit sitting in my bathtub until I can find a large sledge hammer. Don't waste your money with this thing. There has to be a better answer

Bad Unit
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Wish I had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before I purchased this. I went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a Braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 - 15 years.  After it got the new plastic taste out of it, it made good coffee. Even without the Brita Filter.  Just like all the reviewers indicated, the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully.  Unfortunately, it has quit working after only 2 1/2 months.  The seller, Etronics, is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period.  That will be the last thing I buy through them.  Like uhh, since they sell Braun,one would think they would have some recourse through Braun and try to help their customers.  So, here I am between the proverbial rock and a hard place,  try to find a Braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced, or just bite the bullet an go buy another. (want to bet it won't be a Braun?) Additionally, what do we do for coffee in the mean time?  Such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet

I've had two of these now, and they both had one serious flaw: the trumpeted "brew and pause" feature DOES NOT WORK.  Pull the carafe out during brewing and treat yourself to a steaming hot waterfall of coffee that would almost be comical if it weren't such a relentless pain in the neck to clean up.

Exterior  exposed lip reaches 250 degrees on auto setting
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I returned this the day it arrived. I heated the obligatory 4 cups of water as per instructions. Left the room and came back in 20 minutes. The warning light was not lit. I moved the crock to the side to see if I had not properly plugged it in since the light was out. I brushed my hand against the exterior lip and received a first degree burn. Farberwear company customer service said "the light is a little dim" but you should be able to see it. Yes, you can see it if you look up from below the crockpot you will see a faint glow. The crock pot sits very loosely in its container leaving a large gap between the food container and the heater housing.Heat escapes through these gaps which accounts for the overheated exterior. I would advise those with kids, especially, to find another slow cooker

Taylor Professional Thermometer shuts itself off!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I received my Taylor Professional [and] it appeared to be behaving normally except it shut itself off after 4 to 7 minutes even while its readings were changing. Now, it is supposed to save its battery life by shutting off if there is no change in its temperature reading for 10 minutes, but it should stay on if its readings are changing. The temperatures were no where near the extremes of the thermometer's range, so this wasn't a case of shutting down because of that. ... I e-mailed the manufacturer about the problem and was told I could return it to them for replacement. I did this and less than three weeks later received a new one from them. Surprise, surprise -- this one behaved the same way, shutting off after 4 or 5 minutes even while its readings were changing. I e-mailed Taylor again about this and suggested they check out their existing supply of this model, as I suspected they had many that were shutting down like this. ... Approximately two weeks later ... I received another package from them containing one of their model 9845 thermometers, a different model! I received no communications from Taylor about this, other than their original e-mail stating I could return my original thermometer to them for replacement. I don't know what I'll do now. I would like a properly functioning 9878 ...

Cake always stick

I own this pan and the Bavarian and Chrysanthemum models too.  I think Nordicware makes very innovative designs which makes their flaw even more disappointing.  After a few uses, everytime I bake with these pans the cake always stick.  I grease AND flour these pans before baking and the cake still sticks.  One reviewer said to LIBERALLY grease these pans, but I don't understand why there's so much work for greasing a "non-stick" pan.  I had less worries when using a regular tin pan with no "non-stick"

Not nonstick

We had registered for All-Clad pans for our wedding last year, and decided to go with a Calphalon commercial nonstick set instead.  The person helping us highly recommended the Calphalon One infused anodized set instead, and said the demonstrations he had seen were fantastic.  We bought that set and have had it for nearly a year.  We hardly ever use it, however, because things stick so badly, even with oil.  While the set looks quite nice and cleans up easily enough with soaking and Bar Keeper's Friend, I'm very disappointed with how it cooks and would love to be able to return it

At first we loved this pan.  We've used it quite a bit, but recently it has started to warp and it gets worse when it is heated. I can no longer sear a roast and then put it in the oven because the pan is so uneven.  I've contacted All Clad and am waiting to see what they say. Needless to say, I would have been much happier with a less expensive pan.  I am very happy with all the other All Clad pans that we have, but this one is a disappointment

Why is all the steam coming out of the side?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have to agree with the other negative reviews. This insert loosely fits the All-Clad 3-Quart Casserole Pan I bought with it (which I could understand if I were trying to use it with another brand). It being from the same line and company one would think that someone would have tested how well it worked. As with all All-Clad products it's built very well but who cares about that if it doesn't work properly. Someone else mentioned all the perforations are in the bottom of the insert, it would be better if there were holes in the sides as well. I think my artichokes would cook a little faster if tons of steam wasn't rolling out from in between the insert and pan. It works, just not very well.

Bad design/cheap materials
</Text>
</title>
<text>

We're a small restaurant (16 seats), serving dinner 4 nights a week, and we use the blender for soups, Caesar dressing, etc., once or twice a week, but never use ice in it or anything like that. We've had two of this same model now, and had the same problem with both of them. The black collar, the part of the base where you set the container, is plastic, and on both blenders has broken. The first time it lasted almost a year, and we figured that wasn't too bad -- especially when you compare the cost to a true commercial/professional blender, which are $300+. Also, we really like the blender in terms of function, so we picked up another one. This time, the exact same thing happene, except that the collar cracked within 2 weeks!!

This percolater makes great coffee and I was very happy with it until it broke within two years. Actually the first thing that broke was the little plastic knob on the top. I called the company and they were very nice about it. They quickly sent me a replacement part. I thought, what a great company. Then when it would not work one morning just a little over two years after I bought it I called them again. They explained that it was no longer under warranty (I think I missed the warranty term by a month or two.) They offered that I could purchase a refurbished one from them for about half the price of the original (I paid about $70.00, a refurbished one was, I think, $35.00) but it came with no warranty and I'd have to pay shipping. I was very, very disappointed. Thankfully, I had my old drip coffee maker in the attic. I pulled that out and have been using it although it does not make as good a cup of coffee as this percolator did.

I bought this on 8/4/06.  When I first got the coffee maker, I ran plain water through the machine to get the plastic smell out.  Afterwards, the machine still smelled like plastic, now I've ran vinegar through the machine and still no help.  The horrible plastic smell is still there.  Baking soda is no use also.  The only thing I've not used is bleach.  If you don't mind the plastic smell then this is a good small machine that works well with most coffee cups.  Makes really hot cups of coffee and none of the leaking problems

The Sango Splash line of dinnerware is gorgeous, no doubt about it. It's got a lovely combination of colors and textures and it feels great in the hand. So what's the problem? It chips. I've had a set of eight place settings plus various serving pieces and other extras for about two years. At last count, there were five pieces with chips and one cracked cup. That doesn't say much for the set's longevity, especially since I don't use these every day.

I agree with other writers.  This unit is very poorly designed and built.  Cutting my third loaf of bread, the knife point came out of the guide, and on return, snaped one of the guides off.  Not washable, end plate falls off while cutting all the time, unit slides over the counter when trying to cut (rubber feet would have cured this).  I would look elsewhere before buying this unit

The 17 piece set is a great value but quality of the stainless steel is poor. The mirror finish doesn't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water. The bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd. When 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds. I didn't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set. Finding everything that I needed and used was more important. The set does heat evenly and cook well it's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore. This product is great if looking for style and going to hand it up over an Islan

Pretty, but not very functional
</Text>

I like the Calphalon Contemporary line a great deal, and so I was pleased to find the steamer insert that fit my pan.  But my first attempt to use it was a failure--the small steamer holes (and not very many of them) are easily covered by the food to be steamed, leaving the insert to function like a double boiler.  After working for close to an hour to steam summer squash (which should take 20 minutes at most), I gave up and dumped the squash into the steaming water and boiled it.  I'm sure that some foods will steam in this pan, but items that lay flat like sliced vegetables will be a problem

buy a good steam iron instead
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This steamer was only useful to get the wrinkles out of clothes that had been really balled up... it gets them to a state where you can IRON them more easily, but basically saturates with the steam so the fabric is damp. Sure there is technique to learn, but I spent a good long time on several different items. It heats up quick and produces steam well etc, but it performed far below what I thought were reasonable expectations. It also has a low hanger so you constantly have to extend the hose to let the condensation run back down or else get gurgling and low output. I returned it, amazon was good about that, and the return shipping was less than what amazon charged me in the first place

Problems
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
With 3 different speeds you think you would able to make a shake or smoothie in this machine with no problems right? Nope, I am always running into problems with ice getting stuck around the blade assembly, and I do mean stuck!  I have not had this blender for very long, and I really don't use it very often either so there is no reason I should be told my blades are probably dull - its not like I was making a brick smoothie! AHH..  Also why does the lid stain so easily - I have never made anything that contains purple in my blender ans now my lid is permantly that color!  The best thing I can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put, and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands.  I have since purchased a differnt brand and have no problems!  Looks the mixer is the only thing KitchenAid has perfected

Coupler broken after 1 year
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
After going thru several $20 dollar blenders in the last 10 years I decided to splurg and go for the Kitchenaid. Well it didn't last even as long as the cheap ones. The motor is still good, and the blades are still good, but they used a little plastic coupler between the two and it lost all it's teeth one by one. We mainly like to make milkshakes and smoothies about 3 or 4 times a week.

Beautiful - but not worth it

I bought my first one about 14 months ago - it lasted about 8 months.  Motor made a high pitched sound and blew coffee all over.  I dismantled the whole unit - it then worked for about 2 days.  I called Kitchenaid - (they are right about no hassle warranty)  They quickly sent me out a new one.  This new one lasted about 6 months - and now has the same symptoms.  I really wish this was the grinder for me - I LOVE the Capacity for bean storage and LOVE the way it looks - I have been forced to look at other grinders.

I was happy with the performance of the strainer...easy to clean, fit well over the edges of pans, etc. But only a month after I received it, the handle snapped right off. I was draining a can of vegetables, so it doesn't seem to me that was overdoing it. I'll definitely check the fastenings on the next strainer I buy

I baked two batches of madelines side by side, one in this pan (set on a baking sheet), and another in a traditional pan with non-stick coating. I brushed both pans with canola oil before using. As per the package instructions, I allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them. The madelines in the traditional pan released easily, were golden and high, and had a pronounced design. The other batch were almost soggy (probably from cooling in the pan), flat, pale, and did not have the appearance of a madeline. To make matters worse, they did not release easily, and a few of them even broke as I attempted to remove them. I would not recommend this pan

We were so looking forward to fresh lemondade. The moment the Salton arrived we opened the box, pulled out the lemons we had bought in anticipation and began juicing. On the 5'th lemon the gears stripped and the juicer no longer turned when applying even the slightest amount of pressure to the lemon. We were all very disappoined, my 5 kids and I : ( I had hoped for better after reading the great reviews written by some of the others.

Bought it two months ago, used it only twice and suddenly it stopped working within a week. Called manufacturer, got return label, sent in for replacement, but three weeks passed and I still have not received anything. So I called them on Nov 17, 2006, and was told they don't have this model in stock. The worst part is that they also said they do not know when it will be ever in stock, maybe tomorrow or may in a year.

There is one huge problem with these sheets -- they are not permanently pressed.  There is no way to get out the wrinkles, other than by ironing them.  Otherwise, they are fine.  But who in the world wants wrinkled sheets!  You should be able to take them right out of the dryer and fold them with little or no wrinkles -- like your average sheet.  These sheets are full of wrinkles and they look just terrible on the bed.  I cannot believe you are actually selling these things on-line

Great price, poor product. They are beautiful upon arrival. I washed them according to manufacturer's instructions. You would not believe the copius amounts of lint that piled up in the lint catcher of my dryer (usually a sign of poor fabric quality). While folding them up, I discovered that most of the hems had unraveled and frayed. And I hadn't even used them yet! Unbelievable. I returned them for a full refund, including shipping (and I stupidly purchased 2 sets). Goes to show you get what you pay for. Never again

I was at first very excited with my new Zyliss salad spinner - it looks great, and it's much easier to spin than the older string-pull version (not to mention the old-school "pump" versions, which required a lot of effort). However, as another reviewer mentions, it simply does not get your greens very dry. I've been surprised and disappointed by the amount of water left on lettuce after spinning, and spinning, and spinning

Bought this grinder after my Capresso grinder developed a crack in the plastic housing.  After using for about two weeks, I have to agree with other reviews that mention "static problem". The grinds cling to grinder and coffee end up all over the counter when trying to pour into coffee machine.  The plastic cover also somewhat awkard to get on and off.

I cannot believe what a WASTE of money this thing was. HUGE disappointment. I was all excited when I got it, made some cookie press dough, put it in, and... nothing. The plunger pretty much spins in place. I could PUSH the dough out manually faster than this thing can. I couldn't even get ONE FREAKIN' cookie out of it, onto the cookie sheet.

I have had this pan for a year. I bought it because it was on sale and was shopping around for a new pot set. I figured it would be a good test run on the Circulon brand. It grills great,but you will spend  twice the cooking time cleaning the pan! I could not imagine how much food would be left on this pan if someone without great eyesight cleaned it. You have to go along each crevice on both sides of the grill gooves to get the food out. It is very time consuming and tedious and just not worth it. I wonder if the Calphalon pan is the same??? As far as the pot set I ended up buying-Analon Titanium 12 piece. Highly reccomend it

Pros: The oven part works great. I like the fact that it is controlled by a timer, meaning that you can set somthing to cook for 20 minutes and then it turns itself off.  For cooking things, the double rack is also handy, although you only get one pan (luckily, I saved the pan from my old toaster oven).

Also there there is soo much smoke coming from the grill I had to shut off the smoke detector for a while. Overall the food came out pretty good but the mess with the stove really upset me.

I loved the way the Vortex Digital Heater heated and the way it kept cool to the touch.  But within a week, the one I had started cutting off when it hit the set temperature and did not come back on.  I was worried that it was overheating all the time and called Vortex who told me I could send it in at my expense and pay $15 to fix it.  I emailed my Amazon seller (Louise at Pinnacle Packaging) who was wonderful and paid to have it sent back to her, and is going to refund my money.  I think I am going to buy another one only I am going to purchase it from a local store and make sure I can bring it back if the new one does the same thing.  I guess I am a sucker but I really liked the way the thing worked when it worked correctly

And bit the dust. I use it once a year for 3 days. I'm estimating it made coffee 10 times. Now it wont brew anything but weak coffee. If you fill it to 55 cups it takes about an hour to brew. Now it perks for 30 minutes and walla it makes the coffee weak. I was going to call Faberware and noticed they charge 95 cents per minute. For what? Like the last guy said it's an expensive way to make a cup of coffee. It's a throwaway. So,this time I'll buy the west bend for 35 bucks and when it stops working I'll throw it away. At least I wont be thrwing away 150 bucks

Bad thermostat and worse customer service
</Text>

We also bought the FCP12 after years of hearing from satisfied Farberware users. Unfortunately it only worked about three months until it also made lukewarm, tea - like coffee. I removed the bottom and wiggled the wires and it worked great for another month or so. After a few times of this monkey business, I contacted Farberware and was told I had voided my warranty by removing a single nut from the base. The best they could offer was a refurbished unit at half price. Shipping would be on me both directions as well, I told them I would not pay any price for another one of their products, based on our experience and their lack of any desire to acknowledge the widespread problem or help to fix it. I am going to try replacing the thermostat, as I like perked coffee, but I am not convinced it will last any longer, time will tell

Stainless-steel and die-cast aluminum construction promises performance, but the undersized electric motor limits this slicer to very light intermittent household use. The Waring FS800 Pro Electric Food Slicer seems to have a barely adequate motor when brand new with a new sharp blade. Just think how it will perform when the blade gets a little dull. This is definitely not a professional quality food slicer, it is only a light intermittent duty slicer at best

My other liner is a Chef's Planet Full size baking sheet non stick bakeliner and while it can slip a bit and dosn't have a "finished" edge it dose have the advantage of wipe-down clean up and it arrives in a large sheet that you custom cut to fit any baking sheet(s) you will be using it with.  Don't buy this liner but do buy the non stick bakeliner from Chef's Planet.  It's not as pretty but it works like a charm!  After years of buying expensive parchment paper I'll never go back.  Also, it's less wastfull to use a bake liner instead of disposable baking sheets or parchment paper

Bad idea if you are thinking cheesecakes
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I thought the four 4.5 inch springform pans would be equivalent to one 9.0 inch springform pan.  After all, the areas are equal, i.e. 4 * 2.25 * 2.25 * pi == 4.5 * 4.5 * pi.  I thought I could use the recipe for a 9-inch cheesecake and have 4 4.5-inch cheesecakes that tasted the same but were a more convenient size for giving as gifts.

I used my Hoover Agility for the first time and the suction quit after 5 minutes. I followed all the trouble shooting instructions and it still didn't work. I called Hoover and spoke with a rep who was basically reading out of the manual. I sat on hold for 21 minutes only to hear a manager tell me that they cannot give out technical information because it's against their policy. I guess this is to ensure their Hoover service centers get the business. I'm returning the Hoover and NEVER purchasing a Hoover again.

This isn't silicone!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The cutting boards are not silicone but have a thin layer of silicone sprayed over one side of another plastic that is not heat resistant.  I placed a hot pan on one and it melted onto the bottom of the pan which took a great deal of effort to clean the melted plastic off so the pan could be used again.  I prefer a thick cutting board so I bought these thinking that they were heat resistant so I wouldn't purchase them again

I bought this back in 1999, and I love the way it cooks chicken and salmon steaks, but it's not built to last.  First, after about 3 years, the tracks where the door slips onto the bottom broke off due to the screws being too tight, and then the 5th year, the knob broke off, so I have to use pliers to turn it on.  It still cooks chicken great, but after trying to superglue the "feet" back on and the knob, they broke again right away.

We have not been able to use the sheets because they are so stiff and rough.  They are wrinkled and no matter how many times they are washed they do not soften.  The pillowcases are too narrow for our regular size pillows which makes the pillows too high and hard to be comfortable. We are totally dissatisfied and thoroughly disappointed and will be returning them if for no other reason than to get them out of the house.  We do like the color, though

I was very surprised at how large this grill was when it arrived; way too large for my countertop at least;  it just seemed like more trouble than it was worth; it seemed easier for me to just broil food in the oven frankly; I mean the only thing you are going to get from using this grill is the grillmarks on your food; nothing can duplicate the flavor of cooking on an outdoors grill; the size turned me off as well as the inconvenience of using the product.  It is one of those products that you will use once or twice and then it will end up lost somewhere in your cabinets

After cooking eggs this morning and having a layer of egg stuck to the whole pan, I'm sad to say that my non-stick pan sticks.  We've had this pan for maybe 8 months and I just assumed that pans lasted for several years.  We even bought this pan plus the 8" for my mother-in-law for Christmas.  What a disappointment.  Better begin research on a new pan...and I'll make sure to read the reviews.

CAUTION -- They don't warn you about a major problem.

</title>
<text>
<Text>
After your pan starts sticking, you go to their web site to complain and you find .... A warning that you can't use high heat on this pan.  They warn you if you use high heat or some sprays, the pan will then start to stick.  Yes, you've just been ..... and you paid $40 for the privilege.  Imagine, a frying pan that doesn't like heat.  How much heat?  They don't tell you.  If your pan is sticking, then it must have been toooo much.  Buy at your own risk

Buyer Beware
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
If you are planning to purchase anything from getapc.com, the markeplace vendor selling this item, beware.  I purchased the Delonghi 5-Quart mixer based on product description and customer reviews but found that it did not perform as expected.  It froze up kneading a 2-loaf batch of whole grain bread.  The design is beautiful and the mixer is probably good for non-artisan breads, but should you have any problems with it, you'll have to stay on the vendor to get any kind of response.  I am still waiting for a refund on the product after 2 weeks.  The last message I got was that "it may take a bit longer."  So be sure this is what you want before you buy it.  Returning it is not easy.  And getapc.com charges a $60 reshelving fee on top of the shipping you'll have to pay to send it back.  My markeplace experience has been very frustrating.  I won't buy through the marketplace again.  If amazon.com or getapc.com processes my refund in the next day or two, I'll feel better and will edit my review, but for now, buyer beware

The thermometer is only as good as the probe.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I purchased this product 4 years ago and have replaced the probe three times for about $7 each. The latest probe just malfunctioned.  I really loved it at first...perfectly roasted chickens,loin roasts, and turkeys.  Oddly enough, the thermometer works great but the probe itself isn't designed to handle much time in the oven.  If you like to roast your chickens in a hot 400 degree oven ,the probe will eventually stop working or will become completely unreliable.  Even at lower temperatures, the heat finally takes its' toll...it just takes longer for it to happen.  One would think that something designed to be left in the oven would be able to take the heat.  I will buy yet another probe because when this thing is working, it is great.  That is worth $7 a year for me....but not for everyone.  Per another reviewers advice, I am calling Polder

When it worked it worked well.  However, eight months into this -- and I only have used it maybe 6 or 8 times, it's broken.  I have not done anything to it, and one day the the display is just messed up.  I can see a line here and there, but nothing else.  Replacing the battery did not help and Polder's website offers no information such as warranty information.  It is defintely NOT worth $30

I bought this air cleaner in March of 03 and was pleased with the thing until it just stopped working in January 04.  There was no indication that anything was amiss, I was changing the pre-filters on the recommended schedule and then one morning nothing; no lights, no sound, no activity.  Am sending it back to Honeywell (on my nickel according to their warranty policy).  We will see how long the replacement lasts.  I have read several reviews here that don't give me much hope.  Amazon was nice, said I needed to contact Honeywell directly but suggested I post a review

KRUPS is KING

Considering all the bells and whistles on the coffeemaker itself,(all excessive, by the way) the carafes have much to be desired.  It seems as if they are made with spun sugar.  EXTREMELY FRAGILE, awkward handle and like a comment already listed, I too have replaced the carafe twice...making three so far.  My Krups carafe of 10 years is still intact.  If they still made the filters, I would still be using that machine.

The worst food processor ever
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This chopper, if you can call it that, is terrible.  I've tried chopping all kinds of foods from veggies to fruit to nuts to cheese.  I've tried filling up the bowl, half full and barely anything at all.  It doesn't chop.  Plain and simple it just doesn't chop the food.  I've had pieces of vegetables get stuck on the blade.  Then, I'd have to stop and remove the piece and try again.  It started to chop a little a couple of times, but then just stopped and the blade kept spinning while chopping nothing.

</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I was so excited at the prospect of having a 3-cup mini chopper.  I thought it would be ideal for hummus, which I hate to scrape out of my blender.  However, it was very disappointing.  On either speed, it just seems to chop what is in the center, so the stuff on the inside stays on the inside and the outside stuff stays on the outside--unchopped.  If I wanted to take the lid off every two seconds and move everything around, I'd use the blender, no?  I nearly pureed some red pepper, trying to get it all chopped.  I have a 2 cup mini chopper (Procter-Silex, I think) that is really much better at consistent chopping.  I never had to take the top off of it.  Unfortunately, the bowl got warped in the dishwasher (even though it claimed to be dishwasher safe) and the lid does not fit tightly now, making an occasional mess with liquids and crumbs.  Still, even warped, I find myself using the old one instead of this new one--it is really that bad!

Rust on knives

Have been using the set for less than a month. Rust has started to form on the knives just where the blades are fused to the handles - right at the seams. Looks like rust starts from the inside of the handle. Unless design is changed, don't know how replacement knives will be any different. Too bad since knives are sharp and set is designed beautifully

I thought this was the answer to my crock-pot prayers!  I received it for Christmas and was heart broken to realize that you can choose high for 4 or 6 hours or low for 8 or 10 hours.  (Look at the product image enlarged) Most things I cook take 6 hours on low!  I occasionally have something that needs 8 hours but most of the time it is 6 to 7 hours.  Unfortunately, if it doesn't do the time you need, it is completely useless.  You would have to be home to turn it off or down.  So I returned it and am making do with my Select Brands corningware programmable, (it doesn't do 6 hours on low either) and a regular 3 quart.  I just make it home in time or I don't cook it

I found this sealer to be difficult to use.  It is very difficult to get a good vacuum seal due to the clumsy method of putting the bags in a nozzle.  Extreme pressure is needed to hold down and lock the top in order to create the vacuum and seal the bag.  If you let up on the pressure, the vacuum seal is broken.  I returned mine and would never buy another Rival sealer product again

I accidentally ruined my father's old baking stone so I bought this on for him to replace it. Everything sticks to it! We thought maybe it just needed to be seasoned a bit before it stopped sticking. We've had it for over a month and we use it at least four times a week and it continues to make a mess out of anything we bake on it. That's not even the worst of it. It puts out a disgusting smell in the oven. Just last night we used it and had to sit it in the garage and open up the entire house because we all had headaches and our eyes burned from whatever fumes it was releasing. I definitely DO NOT recommend this item.

Dirty Water Drips Back Onto Carpet
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Even though I cleaned the machine between each empty and fill, if I did not have white carpet I would not have known this machine leaks the dirty water back onto the carpet. I had to shampoo the carpet two more times to remove the extra spots left in the carpet. A second time with detergent to remove the spots and then immediately with a rinse only cycle. My second gripe is the clean and dirty water reservoirs are in the same small space. I had to change it out about every 10 minutes. The machine gets one star for the dual brushes which I think are a positive for this machine. Unfortunately, that was not enough for me to keep it. It would have been cheaper for me to hire someone to come in and steam clean my carpet considering the fact I had to clean it three times and this carpet is in a low traffic area. I've had a Hoover for 8-10 years and will look to see what new machines Hoover has on the market.

The V2 is one of the worst built appliances ever especially at about $250. Without exaggeration I have been back to the parts dealer about 10 times for replacement of the front suction piece (breaks), a number of times for the clear water and soap dispenser assembly. It seems to fall apart, leak, and requires constant attention. I now have to go to have a repair of the brushes - they don't rotate. And this is with use maybe once a month. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to manufacture and sell a product with such miserable (and expensive) quality

I liked the mug's look, feel, & size. Then I took a drink of java from this mug... I never could get a lip lock on this mug. The rim is very thin & very wide. It would always spill a couple of drops on my shirt. Nissan mugs have what I call a "lip ledge" that prevents the "dribble" effect to which the Bodum is prone. Nissan mugs also have a much smaller diameter rim which also makes drinking from them less hazardous to my white shirts

Boils fast but this is a flawed kettle
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst.

Hamilton Beach 40616 Perculator Doesn't Last
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
My wife and I purchased the 40616 Hamilton Beach Perculator at K-Mart. After only 8 months of service the perculator would not keep the coffee hot--only luke warm.K-Mart refused to do anything about the problem because they only warranty the coffee pot for 90 days. This should give you an idea of what K-Mart thinks of the quality of the Hamilton Beach 40616 perculator.When I  called Hamilton Beach customer no-service I was told to send in the cord from the coffee pot and a check for $9.95 and they would replace their defective equipment. The $9.95

I feel it was an unlucky day when I bought this pot.  As careful as I tried to be, it was extremely difficult to tell if I had correctly placed the stem (with basket) in the pit.  It had to be by "feel," and half the time it was apparently a hair's breadth off and would not perk.  Or it would perk enough so that the light went on but that the coffee grounds were hardly wet.  It was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot.  A hair's breadth off and again it wouldn't perk.  So each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day I got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds.  I am returning to my old friend, the Farberware FC280.  It may or may not last more than a year but at least I can depend on it

Why would anyone want pots that can't be used on high heat, can't be washed in the dishwasher or can't be scoured for fear of removing their anodized finish.  My Calphalon professional pots were very expensive and it makes me sick that they have preformed so poorly.  I have noticed that many of the positive reviews were by people who haven't owned these pots for long

I just received this knife yesterday &amp; am sending it back for a refund.  Upon first use, the forked metal tip broke off when I was chopping tomatoes for a salad.  It took me a few moments to notice the lost tip (as it had ended up in the salad I was preparing.)  Could have been very dangerous to swallow a sharp metal tip!  The knife itself is flimsy, can't imagine that it could cut a bagel very well

I folowed the instructions and found that the coffee was very weak so I experimented with differint grinds and filter no filter. I found not useing the paper filter and grinding the coffee expresso and stoping the water when it starts to look pale makes a med. strong cup. A lot of work for a decent cup. I still think that my old krups drip makes a great cup. I will keep trying other alternets to the pods becous there very expensive. I am waiting for some one to start manufacturing a home pod maker. that you can fill & seel at home

I thought that this would actually be something that I would need when I registered for this for my wedding. But this is more of a toy for the kitchen than something that you will actually use. Sure kids might like to use it when they cook, but in all the time that I have owned one, I have only used it once. Its more of a hassle because you have to clean it out afterwards. You are better off without it

Overflows Consistently

I bought this coffee maker to match my KitchenAid blender and coffee gridner. The coffee maker is attractive but works terribly. If you make more than 1 or 2 cups it overflows hot coffee onto the counter top. There is almost always grounds in the coffee too. When I called KitchenAid customer service they said they made a revision to fix the problems and sent me another one. It has the same problems. This is NOT user error I have tried different coffees, grinds, and positioning the carafe differently. This coffee maker is just a distrastrous design mistake. Finally I got KitchenAid to buy the coffee maker back and got a Cuisinart one. It works perfectly, costs less, and has more features. I would recommend Cuisinart and highly recommend that you do not buy this shoddy coffee maker - you will regret it.

Disappointing piece of junk
</Text>

I have several other Kitchen Aid appliances and they are all great - solid, hefty machines that do superior work, the type of items Kitchen Aid has built a reputation on.  So that is why I bought this coffee maker (actually I have the previous model before this "update").  Boy, howdy!  Was I blind-sighted!  The quality of the housing is no better than a Mr. Coffee for 1/4 the price, and I too, have experienced the leaking problems like other reviewers have noted.  And on mine, the spring that keeps the shut off unit down while you take the pot off the machine to have that first cup while it is still brewing - well, it decided to not do it's job only after about a month of owning it.  The unit leaks coffee as if that is what it was designed to do.  HEY, KITCHEN AID ENGINEERS - DO YOU READ THESE AMAZON REVIEWS?  IF YOU DO, THEN GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND MAKE A COFFEE MAKER THAT IS IN LINE WITH YOUR OTHER PRODUCTS!  AND GIVE THOSE OF US THAT BOUGHT YOUR PREVIOUS JUNK A FULL CREDIT TRADE IN TO UPGRADE TO IT ONCE IT IS AVAILABLE!  HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE A GOOD COFFEE MAKER?  MY GRANDMA'S EARLY 70'S MR. COFFEE IS STILL PERKING STRONG - WHAT AN EMBARASSMENT TO KITCHEN AID.  Nuff' said

I got this on sale from Targets for $35.  Eagerly I plugged in the unit, turned the variable dial to maximum steam, and increased the digital dial to  7.  And then I waited, and waited, and waited, for 10 minutes.  The iron never warmed up, let alone hot enough to iron anything.  I can't say this is a bad product, but surely I got a non-working unit

I have left 10 voicemails and sent approx 14 e-mails back and forth with their customer service (haha) reps and still have made zero progress. Buy with caution

So, long story short, no cake plate for Mom! Amazon.com should really examine how they pack items like this

I wanted to like this toaster.  It looks nice, seems sturdy enough, and stays cool to the touch.  But it toasts poorly.  One side of the bread toasts more than the other.  So I have to pop up the toast 1/2 way through and turn it over.  And now the pop up mechanism isn't working well

I bought T-fal's top of the line Avantis iron even though I only have light ironing to do. It broke in less than a year - losing heat completely. T-fal would not stand behind it. I wrote to them several times. They insisted on the original sales receipt despite the fact I had the charge on my American Express bill. They had no technical advise either. Read other Amazon reviews on their products breakdowns! I've paid half as much for irons that lasted for years. Avoid this turkey and this company. I'll never buy another T-fal product and neither should you

A normal coffee maker requires a quick rinse; this machine requires a wash, rinse and a thorough drying of the grinding unit.  You can't just rinse the grinding unit because the fine coffee grounds need to be washed out.

A friend bought a food saver by Tilia and told me that it would be wonderful for storing my bulk shopping in the freezer.  I saved for it and got it.  I used it a total of 10 times and not for long periods of time and it literally died.  I sent it back to the factory asking for a refund and they refused and sent me a refurbished one in return - they will not refund your money on the poor quality items they sell.  Just be careful and do not let this happen to you - Tilia looks much better on TV than it performs in real life.

The top portion of the freezer works great.  The bottom drawer portion sounded great - no more digging to see what's at the bottom.  The reality is that the bottom drawer is only useful as overflow from my refrigerator. I don't put anything in that part that I'm not willing to store at regular refrigerator temperatures.  It's a disappoinment

The reason:  it doesn't preserve the wine.  I am seeking a return and refund, either through Amazon or Metrokane

I honestly liked the blender a lot.

At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid's brand and durability behind it.

Broken after 18 months- KA refused to fix

I find that such a well-known brand would have a longer warranty than 12 months. My blender broke (it was the "coupler") after about 18 months of use. I emailed KA about it and all they did was give me two repair shops where I could pay to have it fixed. Both repair shops are more than one hour away. They also offered me [...] off a "refurbished" blender. Gee...what service. You'd think they'd at least work with me since the blender wasn't even 2 years old. For [...] I went out and bought a Cuisinart and that comes with a 3 year warranty. KA blender was not worth my [...]. It never blended fruit all the way, either; it always left chunks of bananas

The salesclerk told us that because of previous model recalls, that the new KitchenAid was sure to be a huge improvement, especially with it's price tag.  We've tried 2 models and both had problems with error messages.  The manual's suggestions do nothing to eliminate this.  Also, we've had the same trouble with coffee spewing out.  For the price tag, this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker.  We finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model (NOT KitchenAid).  Oddly enough, our other KitchenAid appliances (range and fridge) have also had electronic problems.  I wonder what the quality control is on the parts that are being cheaply manufactured, no doubt, in some overseas location.  I wouldn't recommend KitchenAid to anyone, regardless of the nice styling and supposed high-quality.

This Krups espresso maker leaves water and steam all over the counter every time it is used. I think the "built in safety" features are to blame. The finer the grind, the more water leaked out. Keep in mind that fine grinds are recommended for espresso and cappuccino.

I jumped on purchasing this machine when I saw it. I was tired of storing beans in the freezer. I put 4 AA batteries in it and a pound of beans, closed the lid and the sucking sound started...and it kept going, and kept going, and kept going. I started looking for places to store it so that it wouldn't wake me up at night or disturb me with it's annoying hum first thing in the morning. But I didn't have to worry, but the next morning the batteries were dead. I replaced them and within 24 hours they were all dead again!  There is no place to plug it in so you're stuck with using batteries. I'm going to try buying rechargables but I don't know how long I'm going to want to keep this replacement going!!

The perfect appliance--if you have 20 minutes for toast

What a shame that this appliance fails at its sole purpose in life.  Let's hope there's a support group for mediocre toasters

A workhorse of a coffee pot

A well made no frills percolator.  It packs well,is quite simple to use and makes a great cup of coffee.  The ideal coffee pot for camping or outdoor use.  A superior product compared to the many flimsy coffee pots made for campers

I would have given this no stars but it won't let me. This non-stick griddle has more things stick to it than tape.  It is simply the worst product I have purchased in a long time.  I have this "non-Stick" griddle for just about a month and it is ready for the trash.  The non-stick is coming up on the flat end and the griddle is worthless, it ripped my chicken cutlets to shreds.  Don't buy it!!! If you read this and still buy it may you have three horrible meals like I did before it met the old trash can

After one wash the fitted sheet shrank and color leeched onto it so it has grey splotches in places. We don't even have a deep mattress but now the bare mattress shows on the sides. It'll have to go in our next garage sale.

I purchased this about 1 year ago and it's only taking up space in my house.  It has very poor suction on carpeting.  Works O.K. on hardwood floors but then again most of these will.  I expected better force.  The small openning may look "cool" but it doesn't allow for wide enough sweeping area and I find myself going over the same area again and again.  Also, the charging holder is a little harder to place the unit in.  I would consider look at others first

I am on my third machine now, and it too is leaking.  Dont get me wrong, the coffee tastes really good, always fresh.  But after a while the machine starts to leak when you are making a cup of coffee.  I guess the machine only cost 25 bucks now, so if you dont mind only using it for a month it is a great buy

I bought this cookie press to make my favorite Christmas cookies-Spritz.  I got the dough into the gun, squeezed the handle, kept squeezing the handle, and nothing.  The mechanism that was supposed to push the dough out thru the disk kept slipping, and hence, no cookies.  It was very frustrating, having everything ready to make the cookies, but with no way to properly form them.  I would not recommend this cookie press

Took too long to ship, then got wrong color!
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
This is a disapointment for me. I ordered these sheets in white, and recieved ivory. (unlike other reviewers I am not talking about a tinge of ivory, my package said IVORY instead of WHITE.) I would return these sheets, but they are a gift for my mother, and since they took so long to ship, I won't have time to get her anything else! I have never had a bad experience with Amazon products, some of the third party sellers could be better, but usually Amazon it's self is pretty good. Not in this case! The sheets do feel nice, and hopefully they work out for my mother, but I am keeping my paperwork and packaging just incase she runs into any problems!

We purchased the George Foreman 8 in 1 with the thought we would get the toaster oven we needed and some other features that would be nice to have.  The 8 in 1 does have alot of neat features, the issue is it doesn't do any of the features very well.  The toaster feature takes about 2 times as long to toast as a smaller, more conventional toaster oven.  The Rotisserie is difficult to use and the grease catcher woefully inadequate.  We found out the hard way when we had chicken grease overflow out of the grill and onto the counter.  I can see this being a very good item for those with very small kitchens and in need of saving space, however, be warned that this oven has many shortcomings

Definitely not up to typical Cuisinart standards. While the roaster is a nicely polished stainless which makes for easy cleanup, it's relatively thin. In a 400 degree oven, the pan actually bows.

I don't know what the other reviewers of this blender are blending...but this blender is junk.  I have tried twice to make smoothies with it and this blender cannot do the job.  All of the ingredients just sit there while the only part of the mix being blended is at the very bottom.  So, you have to keep stirring and stirring and stirring the mixture to get it all incorporated.  And then try adding the crushed ice.  This blender is going back.

Bad DeLonghi Experience
</Text>

We purchased a DeLonghi toaster oven and both the toaster and oven functions stopped working right after the one year warranty expired. We barely used this product. When contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us. My $20 toastmaster lasted more than 15 years! This is the lsat time I buy a toaster based on appearance

I received the DeLonghi XR640 Toaster Oven and was disappointed to find it unuseable. The wire rack inside was such a tight fit, it took 2 hands to pull it out! After a few times doing this, the enamel finish was starting to come off, which would soon result in rusting metal. I never turned it on, just returned it immediately.

I've been happy with many other KitchenAid products, but this one is pure junk. The pasta roller attachment that KitchenAid also offers is great, but the width of it is so close to the size of this ravioli press, that the edges of the ravioli barely have enough dough to seal - and many of them pop open.

Cuisinart - tough to clean
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
While the combined grinding and making of the coffee in one unit is a great idea, the mess that it created was a pain to clean up each day.  The grounds would get caked in on all three removal parts and each part needed to be cleaned before using again.  I had the product three months and it quit working.  The good thing is that when we call Cuisinart's 800 number, they told us to just return the item to the store that we purchased it at and we got our money back.

I am currently looking for other brands of this knife style as I was unhappy with the manufactures complete lack of response regarding my complaint

I have used the steamer once, and was disappointed at how long it took. The steam comes out weakly and splattered water on the garment several times. I was just trying to take the store creases out of a new pair of lightweight cotton trousers, and it took a lot of going over to get it done. I used to have a small hand steamer that put out a real blast of steam and worked much faster. This one will probably work on heavier material like drapes, but it will take a very long time. I wouldn't buy it if you plan to use it for anything other than very delicate items, and it seems like a lot of equipment to lug out for that job. A hand unit makes more sense to me, and you wouldn't have to maneuver that long hose. This is just one more large thing to store. I wish I could return it to Wal-mart, but will probably give it away and buy something that is easier to use

A Big Fat Joke & A Waste Of Money

I am a trained research assistant; therefore, I try to research products before I purchase them.  In the case of this purchase, I saw the item during an early bird sale at Kohls, so I grabbed it.  I owned a professional steamer that was purchased at a store that was going out of buisness, but it is really bulky, so I thought that the compact steamer would be a great choice.  On the contrary, it was a big waste of time trying to dewrinkle a blouse, and although it was on sale, it was a waste of money.  The problems I had were:

This is NOT Aubergine, a dark purple like the color of eggplant skin, but it is a light, bright purple.

Caveat emptor, unless you're color blind or really like bright purple

I just bought this toaster (not on Amazon) to replace a Black&Decker toaster oven that had served well for more than 10 years.  This new toaster oven burst into flames when making toast filling my house with rank smoke and nearly setting my kitchen cabinets ablaze.  This is a very dangerous appliance that, based on my experience and other reviews here, should probably be taken off the market and recalled

We have only been using the sheets for 2 months and it is already pilling (balling up) very badly.  It is already affecting my husbands sleep so we are on a search for another sheet set.  When you see 500 thread count, you expect more from the sheet but I guess we should have know what to expect given the low price.  I suppose you get what you pay for.  Take my advice and don't throw away this $$

Crack easily
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Although I like the concept of these storage containers, they crack very easily.  The bottom of one of the largest containers had cracked during shipping. (Still useable for dry things like flour)  Then as I was sitting on the floor putting the containers away in a bottom cabinet, I dropped on from 1-2 feet above a linoleum floor -- it too chipped and cracked at the point of impact.  Also, when I first unpacked the containers, one of the lids came apart and the bottom half became stuck in the container.  We had to use a knife/fork and 2 people to pry it out, doing some damage in the process.  I believe the Click Clack folks have developed a second or even third generation of these containers.  Perhaps they are sturdier.  On the positive side, I did store some tomatoe sauce in one of the containers and it did not stain

Black Goo and Funny Smell
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The design is ok. Nothing fancy, nothing different, it looks just like any other teakettle. It works fine. The handle doesn't get hot, and the whistle isn't too loud. I gave it one star because of the black goo that came inside. I washed it before using it, and after the water was done boiling, I saw little black particles floating in the water and the water smelled weird. The smell may have been caused by that black stuff. I washed the pot again and saw more black stuff coming out. I took one piece and noticed it was gooey. I checked if there was something that had melted when I boiled the water, but I saw the kettle was intact. I boiled more water and again I saw the black goo floating in the water. I have boiled water 7 times and have washed the pot 4 times, and there is still goo floating in the water, they are almost unnoticeable, like very tiny dots, but they are there. At least the funny smell is gone. I don't know what that black goo is or what's causing it or where it's coming from. I'm afraid it may contain dangerous metals or chemicals that can be harmful. If I keep seeing black goo, I'm sending it back. I think I've learned my lesson. When it comes to buying cookware, it's better to buy good quality. It's not worth jeopardizing your health to save a few bucks.

Very disappointing!  Spend your money somewhere else.  I threw away a perfectly good but old made in the USA Thermos bottle and bought this made in China Nissan 0.79-Quart Stainless-Steel INSULATED Bottle back in June of 2005.  Ten Months later this bottle stopped keeping anything warm and would feel warm to the touch after you poured warm liquids in it - evidence of the loss of its insulating function.  I think it lost the vacuum in the cavity which I think is the method used to insulate the liquid inside.  When you spend $25 one would think it's a good quality product - Think again

Well this themometer did a lousy job at staying clipped onto the pot, it kept falling off no matter how I put it on. I even tried using other pots, but no luck. I am so mad that I paid so much money for this crappy gadget, it sucks

I used this thermometer fewer than 10 times before it stopped working.  For the most part, it no longer registers any temperature, and when it does it reads 75-100 degrees too cool.  While it was working, I definitely preferred it to my analog candy thermometer because it was less bulky, but I certainly can't recommend it now.

This is a neat idea ruined by shoddy manufacturing. First of all, this coffemaker is a lot bigger than most regular ones, especially the height. I can't fill this one without pulling it all the way out to the front of the counter. This takes up a lot of room for small kitchens or crowded countertops. The whole thing is also made out of plastic with a very cheap look and feel as soon as you take it out of the box. In just about 3 months of daily use, I've already had water or coffee leak out of the dispenser four times. Between the constant waste of space and having to watch out for leaks, I'd rather go back to pouring my own cups. The only reason I haven't thrown it out is because my wife bought it and I don't want to hurt her feelings

I purchased this unit due to the fact that you could dispense without a coffee pot. In the past I have usually ended up breaking the glass carafe that comes along with traditional coffee makers. At first, I was very pleased with the unit and thought I made a great purchase. Eventually it started to drip and leak at random. The handle in the water/coffee holder broke. The top of the unit that lifts up broke off completely and now just sort of sits there precariously. Finally, this week it decided that it was not going to work at all. It will not make coffee. It will turn on, but not brew. I have only had this for a year and a half or so. Look elsewhere if you are looking for something that is going to last. (it was only used 2-3 times a week

No Need for Cups, Slurp It Off the Counter
</Text>

<Text>
We received the Hamilton Beach BrewStation 12 Cup Coffeemaker as a gift from my sister-in-law.  She loved hers and had used it for a few months so she bought one for us.  Shortly after buying this for us, her coffeemaker started leaking.  She thought it was just worn out from the six months of use and purchased a different type to replace hers.

My spouse operates this vacuum daily until the rechargeable nickel-cadium battery is dead to avoid any memory issues.  Like the Black & Decker 15.6V CHV1560 cordless hand vacuum, the battery life is 4 months tops.

I have had this product for about 2 years.  When we first got it, it worked great--lasted about 10 min. at a time.  Now, we're lucky to get the floor cleaned up under the table before it starts to wear down.  Also, the clip which holds it to the base just broke, and I see that I am not the first person to experience this problem.  I don't see anywhere to buy a replacement base, at this time, so I may end up just throwing the whole thing away

stripped gears
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
I am very disappointed with this product.  I was carving my Thanksgiving turkey yesterday when the knife stopped working after it got hooked on bone in the wing.  The motor continued to work, but the blades stopped moving.  The knife has only been used 3 times, but I had to throw it out today.  I opened the plastic case, and found a metal worm gear coming off the motor shaft,and a cheap nylon gear attached to it to move the blades back and forth.  The nylon gear was stripped and the knife was useless. My prior knife, much less expensive, lasted for 18 years.  The Cuisinart knife is not well made and only works well when it is not under any stress.

Poor quality - a great disappointment
</Text>

I bought this coffee pot after owning the older version of the grind and brew.  Silly of me to think this would be an improvement.  The front load basket design is terrible.  It is a true "pain" to clean this section, you cannot get your hands or any tool I have in my kitchen to clean the mechanisms.  Therefore, the brew basket sticks and at times the latch that holds the basket in will at times be gummed up.  Then when you start to brew your coffee thinking that the latch is closed, its not - its gummed up.  Not a problem until the heat and moisture from the brewing coffee loosen the gunk up and your basket shoots out and the coffee brews all over your counter.  As many times as hubby and I try to clean this its become too much of a pain, this coffee pot is out of here... and on its way to the curb.  I actually am contemplating sending it back to cuisinart in pieces!!!!!!

Dislike button pause and pour
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I am not a fan of the pause and pour feature. IT is a button and if the pot is not directly under button the coffe over flows. On two occasions the machine stopped dripping coffee in the pot, casing grounds to overflow the filter. I can only assume the pot was not perfectly placed. I searched for a red coffee maker at a resonable price but could find none without this type of pause and pour. I may have to remove button for 100% satisfaction. But I love the red accents in my kitchen

Cooker From He__!!

Wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this insane appliance.  Nothing "slow" about it-- burns everything, even on the Keep Warm setting.  Best you can get out of it is 4 hours before you absolutely have to return home and shut it off.  If not, your evening meal is small burnt pieces of food welded to the bottom of the pot. I swear, this thing is possessed!  My old Rival Crock Pot was the best appliance I ever purchased, this one is the WORST!

Why anyone thinks this is a good iron is beyond me
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought this iron based on the recommendations here and was terribly dissapointed. First of all, the iron is very big and heavy. That's not really a problem by itself, but when the iron leaves wrinkles on a shirt as much as it did, it becomes a big problem. The controls were hard to deal with. Turning the iron on and to the setting desired involved getting under the holder. I can see someone burning their hand on a hot iron by accidentally reaching underneath to get a grip in order to work the controls on a hot iron.

Maybe I just have stains that are too much for it, but this cleaner didn't seem to do very much, certainly not enough to warrant paying the extra for it versus normal cleaners. And I'm not using it on very old Le Creuset either, everything I have is less than a year old. Maybe it does better on older stains!

The size is nice for 2 people.  Cleaning is easy.  Seems to be a defect in that the unit has to sit just right on the base or it will not go on and off by itself.  You have to juggle it to be sure it is seated just right to get it to come back on after the oil is heated up and then you have to be real careful that it stays seated just right.

This grinder has a small capacity [not as advertised].  If you follow directions, it will only grind enough for 4 cups at a time. Also, for some reason it generates a static charge and there is coffee dust all over the counter after emptying it. The cord is stiff and the cord storage is inconvienient. Finally, it is much more noisy than my old one

After reading the reviews here saying that the chemical smell mentioned by others was not a problem for them, I went ahead and ordered this rice cooker.  After I received the cooker, I was a little disappointed to find that it was made in china, rather than japan, and that there were some very noticeable imperfections in the fit and finish.

I handwashed this one time and it filled up with water. I didn't expect to be able to wash it in the dishwasher but I also didn't expect it to fill 45% up with water the first time I washed it by hand. The water has since evaporated but I haven't tried to use the thermometer since and I won't use it without using a second one to calibrate this one to see if it is anywhere close to accurate. Not exactly what I was looking for

First, when you use the temperature probe, the meat temperature shows on the display. Also, it is very easy to set the temperature alarm. However, there is a small switch that must be turned on to activate the alarm. Good for one burned roast. Granted, a mistake you will only make once.

I was very unhappy with this product.  I ordered several cannisters and 3 out of 5 cracked after the first use!!!  I did everything that they recommended and they all cracked in the same manner.  The people at Foodsaver were very happy to replace them because they are under "warranty" but I am surprised to see how fragile this product is.  FYI, they will not warranty the products sold on E-Bay.  I should have listened to the reviews and not taken a chance on this product.

Hopefully they will come out with an updated one, until then my search for a good 2 burner grill pan continues

The blade broke after 14 months of use.  And to take advantage of the warranty, I learned that I was required to send THEM a check for $4.00 for processing costs, not to mention the cost that I would incurr to ship it to them.  It was an adequate grinder at best, so I'm definitely not going to bother returning it (I assume that this is Cuisinart's reason for having such a lame warranty in the first place).  I wonder if the rest of their product line is like this.  Until now, I thought Cuisinart was a name you could trust.  I'm very disappointed

FIRE HAZARD

<Text>
I bought this vac to help clean up behind my 19 month old daughter and my 2 pets.  I used it once without a problem, seemed to work reasonably well for a hand vac.  The 2nd time I used it I was cleaning up kitty litter tracked from the litter box.  The 1st pass went fine but then as i was getting ready to make a 2nd pass to finish the job it started whining and it stopped working.  I turned the machine off, checked for any clogs or hair of any kind that may be causing the interference but i found nothing.  I manually moved the brush around a couple of times without a problem, so i turned it back on.  It was still not working and then within 2 seconds it started to smell like something was burning.  I turned it off and it was smoking pretty heavily, which lasted for at least 2-3 minutes before cooling off. Don't waste your $$ on this and more importantly don't risk your safety with this fire trap

Spout that spills and leaks....for shame!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Who had the bright idea with putting the spout so low that this thing will boil thru so easily? since it doesn't make any noise that it is boiling, you know when the water start to burst thru the spout area and it is not a good thing. And what is up with the leaky spout in the weld area anyways? Welding is a skill that if done right, it would NOT leak! The handle will get hot so wear your glove. On the plus side, the stainless steel looks very nice which is why i bought it in the first place. I use to have a cheap tea pot that cost half the price of this one and it was more reliable (lasted 2 years) so that just goes to show that just because it cost more, it don't mean it would last longer. Mine start to leak after 4 months. I am going to buy that cheap one again if they still makes it.

This kettle has so many design flaws I don't know where to start.  It doesn't whistle when it boils so if you leave the room you could have serious overflow before you get back.  The spout is at such a steep angle that it often pours beyond the cup.  The shape (especially the angle) of the handle means that it gets very hot -- I can't hold it without a pot holder -- and your hand gets scalded by the steam when you pour the water.  Mine also already started rust on the outside.

Look carefully at where the spout is mounted. If you fill above this line, with the lid on tight, when it boils, boiling water shoots out of the spout. And the lid fits so tight it is hard to remove without burning.

I received the Delonghi deep fryer on Friday evening and had it at the post office on Monday morning.  I did everything EXCEPT stand on my head to get it to make potato chips...smaller batches, larger batches, shorter cooking times, longer cooking times.  What I did get, consistantly, resembled more a potato cake which was soggy in the middle.  I bought a Waring Pro at William Sonoma for $40 more and had beautiful potatos Monday evening.  Bottom line...Delonghi may be a bit cheaper and a tad easier to clean, but I want good tasting food

This machine is the only sub-$3000 machine I could find that would make a cappuccino with the push of one button.  However, after an hour of trying, I could not get the machine to do anything other than display a message saying the grind was too fine.  The DeLonghi service number blamed it on the plastic float in the water reservoir, the simplest and cheapest looking mechanism imaginable.  I was having second thoughts about their quality control for a machine whose all-plastic construction did not inspire confidence to begin with, when the service person, after conferring with a colleague, decided there could be something more seriously wrong with the machine and that I should  exchange it.  Knowing that super automatics in general are not known for their reliability, I envisioned years of chronic problems with this machine.  I opted for a refund from Amazon instead and am relieved I did

Please do your self a favor and do not buy this item.  As a toaster oven it burns the bottoms of everything you heat in it.  As a toaster to toast bread or bagels, well it still has yet to toast anything for us.  You can run the toaster 6 times and it will never toast/brown.  I was shocked that this item would be so bad being that Hamilton Beach is a good brand.

Gigantic Disappointment

Thought for years, I was missing something by not having a Cuisinart!  What a laugh.  In the few months I have had this unit, two pusher assemblies have cracked and broken.  I did read the manual from cover to cover and watched the video prior to using.  This is an obvious design defect.  Guess I was lucky, in that first replacement was made without a hassle or having to return anything.  Now they want the broken item returned, which is an inconvenience and a delay.  I was without my replacement last time, at least six weeks.  I plan to return this item and purchase a different brand

<Text>
Maybe I just don't understand what this is supposed to do.  KitchenAid attachments are usually wonderful enhancements to their basic appliances.  But I haven't been able to create volume or foam in drinks with this attachment.  Can't see that it does much more than a spoon, and certainly doesn't do as much as a plain wire whisk.  It's not portable like those cheap, little drink mixers.  When I'm at home, I have my immersion blender  -  a much better option for mixing liquids.  Maybe this is good for something I haven't tried yet

It picked up great but one month before the warranty expired the thing made terrible noises and didn't self-propel correctly. Sent it in for repair, took a month. They said "nothing" was wrong and sent it back, but now it works. I wouldn't buy another one. For $300 it should last more than a year before repairs are needed.

Bought the vacuum on oct 1 2005.  Brought it back to the store on Oct 7th. The belt broke! Thought it was a fluke. Tried one more...Brought it back after 10 days.  A piece went flying after using the hose. the suction on the hose then did not work!  Overall the cleaning was great.... while it worked.

First of all I'm a Dyson fanatic....I have a total of three (one on each floor).  When we bought our cabin I couldn't stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one (they are pricey) for carpet I'm on five or six times a year so I bought this.  At first I was thrilled.  It was wonderful.  After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction.  Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids, pets or real dirt.  I would doubt that it's on except that it's noisy and takes off without me.  I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked.  Also the "dirt container" is sometimes hard to remove and put back.  Feels like it's catching on something.  What a waste of money.  Even in my college days I've never had a worse vacuum.  I highly recommend the Dyson instead or even the $50 Dirt Devil I gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing.  To me "Hoover" spells "DISAPPOINMENT"

Piece of Junk!
</Text>

This is the WORST vacumm cleaner I have ever had! It has continually broken down since I bought it and is now again dead. It's only 1 1/2 years old! While under warranty (the first year), I went through 5 belts, a roller brush, and the motor burned out. It is no longer under warranty, and of course, it broke down again. It smokes like it's on fire, and I believe that it's the roller brush *again*. Now mind you, my house is only 1600 sq ft, and half of that space is wood flooring, so I don't have an excessive amount of carpet. Nor do I vacuum excessively. Maybe once a week. I complained to Hoover and they basically told me "too bad". And it's not like it's an inexpensive vacuum at $289!

Mine worked reasonably well for about 7 months; then stopped switching itself off and eventually overheated the plastic bulkhead which holds the coil, giving off a strong (presumably toxic) odour of melted plastic, also affecting the taste of the water. Amazon does not sell this item in Britain, where it would never get through the safety tests required by consumer legislation, but apparently they are quite happy to put American lives in danger

The tea kettle is inexpensive, but I'd spend more to get a tea kettle that whistles and also has a top that flips open from the handle instead of one where you have to manually pop it off.  In addition, the handle gets hot, and you need an oven mitt to hold it

Nice size and shape, but started to split apart after first use.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Like many large wood surfaces, a peel is made from several strips of wood laminated together. However, this peel developed a split after just one use. The instructions indicate maintenance is achieved by wiping with mineral oil, so perhaps you should do this before using the first time. I imagine there are heavier peels available which may be worth checking out.

works so so, company has exaggerated performance claims
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Breville chiller works so so based on the 6 minute claim the company states. To get it cold like in your refrigerator it took more like 14-15 minutes--still faster than a fridge though. Also, the description is sort of deceptive since it says new freezer gel packs, "no messy ice". I thought you just use these freezer packs and thats it--note you still need access to a freezer to freeze the gel packs before using. Also, you still need to add water and the freezer packs don't really last that long. If you want to chill more than 1 bottle, I ended having to use good old ice cubes since the freezer packs were spent. Its a bit messy trying to chill anything other than wine bottles since a typical drink can/bottle will be submerged under the water bath and the only way to retrieve it is to dunk your hand in the cold water. Also, if you are chilling allot of beverages, there is no way to pour out the excess water as the ice melts--they should put a drain spout at the bottom--I had to unplug the unit and dump the excess water over the sink. It does work being faster than your fridge or freezer, but the companies performance claims are a bit exaggerated

I tried to chill my white wine in seven minutes and it was still warm. They say chill, but what does that really mean? They should say what temperature it chills to in 7 minutes. I guess that is why they have a 15 minute timer. Also the description does not state that you have to add water so it is just as messy as an ice bucket and as much work.

The description does not tell you that you still have to add water to unit in addition to the gel packs. I chilled my chardonnay for seven minutes and it was still warm. I had to chill it for 20 minutes to get it cold enough to drink. Gel packs don't allow you to chill several bottles without having to refreeze them or add ice to the machine.

It's great, if it works!!!  After keep exchanging it over and over, I gave up the 5th time. First time, spray didn't work, second time, power steam button didn't release the steam, third time, it was too strong fabric got stock underneath the iron and I couldn't clean the iron, fourth time, steam problem again, fifth time, steam problem again. Poorly tested product. I would've been really happy to keep it, if it was working properly. It actually had all the features I was looking for. Too bad for Rowenta for not testing their products properly.

Cast iron is the only way to go when you are cooking on anything over 30,000 BTUs.  Lodge has a lock on this market.  Trouble with this wok is the sides are not high enough.  As soon as you start mixing, your food goes  sliding up and over the side.  Also, for the extreme weight, the handle  should be wider; distributing the weight a little more broadly for the weak  hand hold.  I gave mine away after three months.  I wish they would change  the design; I'd buy three

Does not live up to function as claimed

<text>

I bought this thing due to my inablity to handle heat effectively anymore like I used to. The unit was not deffective or anything like that, but it also only works under very specific conditions and that window is small. While it is stated in the manual that it's not an A/C unit or super powerful and that it works off of evaporation. I found it to be nothing more than an inconvienance than effective. The fan at the back of the unit doesn't have enough power to move the lightest of feathers let alone allow one to feel anything. While the manual claims that the fan is for cooling the back of your neck I find it is more functional to the evaporation chambers. Overall, the unit just keeps your neck wet and doesn't really cool anything. I found that the unit did work a little more noticably if it was not that hot out and you stood still. Anything over 85 degrees and it fails.

Refurbished Product is Garbage
</Text>

I cannot recommend purchase of the refurbished Roomba Discovery 4210. While I think the product did a good job on BARE floors (not carpet), now after only 4 months of light use (we only used in the kitchen/den area of our home), the unit is trashed. The refurb warranty is only 90 days and that's apparently all the machine is good for. I purchased a new APS fast charger in an attempt to rule that problem out, but it did nothing. This seems to be typical of this vacuum since the Roomba rep I talked to told me that if the charger failed the Roomba was "probably trashed". She was right. If you want  to try this machine stick with the new one, at least you'll get a one year warranty. But I recommend staying away altogether

I've had this kettle for less than 2 years. After reading good reviews, I decided to purchase this kettle because I wanted something that would last with daily use. I disliked it from the beginning. Why? 1) It's heavy. 2) When you open the lid to fill it with water (you shouldn't fill it just through the spout because then all the deposits are on the wrong side of the filter), water that has collected around the lid leaks out and runs down the outside of the kettle. 3) After less than 2 years of use, it is no longer working properly. It constantly switches off during heating. I've had better use from a cheap plastic kettle, and will be going back to using one of those

I purchesed this product not too long ago and whoever disigned it should take a look at the silverware basket.  They sould come up with a better way to drain the silverware because the silverware basket hangs over the counter in every position I tried.  Needless to say, I took it back because the basket would have drained my silverware all over my counter and not in the drain board. I think its a nice dish rack but the basket has to be redisigned to drain in the drain board and not over the counter. Looks are very decieving, in the picture it looks like the basket is over the drain board but its not.  I hope this helps others before they decide to buy this product

Makes a Yogurt Drink
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The first time I used this yogurt starter and it did not thicken I thought that it was my technique.  After reading and making several sucessful batches using store bought yogurt for the starter, I tried another batch using the Rolmex starter purchased at the same time as the original failed starter.  The results were the same:  no thickening, just liquid.

I purchased the Melitta Mill in April, it's now July and the thing is shot.  We used it daily to grind 2 tablespoons of coffee, first the switches stuck and then we had to plug and unplug it to run the thing.  Sure it was inexpensive, but you should get more than three months out of the purchase.  $6+ a month just to grind coffee?  Don't buy this poorly constructed product.

I received this grinder because I had purchased a defective Melitta Grind & Brew coffee maker through Amazon.  The coffee maker had electrical problems and I sent it back to the manufacturer as the manual instructed.  To make a very long story short---Melitta was not able to replace the coffee maker.  They stopped making them.  Amazon had my money and I waited over 4 frustrating months for a coffee maker.  Amazon would not help me and after many, many phone calls Melitta sent me another coffee maker and the coffee mill to compensate for the Brew and Grind.  Grinder malfunctioned periodically and finally died with in 9 months. WARNING--DON'T BUY MELITTA PRODUCTS AND RETURNS FOR DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE SHOULD BE RETURNED TO AMAZON.

I, too, am SO disappointed with this product. When our DeLonghi toaster oven died after 15 years, my husband and I went shopping for a new one. Numerous reviewers and salespeople informed us that DeLonghi toaster ovens just weren't as good as they used to be, so we decided to try the KitchenAid oven. It appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we'd always been satisfied with. The oven, which was bought from a major retailer, looked fine, but the timer and bell were out of synch. Even worse, while the top coils heated up nicely, the bottom ones heated very unevenly. KitchenAid Customer Service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense. Less than a week later the new oven arrived. It looked perfect. But again, it didn't work. This time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up. After preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner's manual, we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom. Now we'll have to return this oven as well, and we've pretty much given up on getting a KitchenAid one at all

Doesn't Do The Job
</Text>

The product is labeled as a seed grinder, so you would expect it to be able to grind seeds, but it failed miserably. I tried grinding flax seeds (about the size of sesame seeds) but about half of the flax seeds made it through the grinder intact. I even tried running the "ground" seeds through a second and third time but still wound up with a large portion of whole or almost intact seeds. That was with the grinder on the fine setting. It seems to be a combination of poor design and cheap parts. The "grinding" wheels are made of plastic which is not the best material for friction and the design allows a lot of the seeds to drop off the wheel into the chute without having actually been "ground" by the wheels. If you're wanting to grind a very small amount of seeds, try a manual grinder. If you're wanting to grind a medium to large amount of seeds, spend more money and get a proper flour mill

The decription says it is a 9x5 loaf loaf dish.  I was thrilled. I have been looking all over to find one that size in glass.  I was so mad and disappointed when I opened the box and it was 8.5 x 4.5.  That wasn't what I ordered.  And yes when baking bread there is a difference.  I am still waiting on my postage-paid return label so I can ship this back. This would have been a great deal, except I already have the 8.5 x 4.5 pans.  They need to change the dimensions in the description.  Buyer beware!

I was so happy when I received this sheet set. It looks beautiful (that's the reason why I am still giving 1 star). But after a couple of nights of use the fitted sheet became ruff. THEY PILE!!!!

I'm normally a fan of OXO products and own many of their gadgets. These measuring cups are the first problem product I've had from OXO...both the 2 cup and 4 cup sizes cracked on the bottom of the cup, right at the plastic injection point (that little circle with the tiny bump in the center of it), and they both now leak at the crack. These cracks developed very soon after I bought them, and I only ever washed them in on the top rack of the dishwasher. Because of the design of the cups, it's kinda annoying to wash them by hand - and they're not great for measuring dry ingredients for the same reason. So mine have gone into the garbage can, replaced by the KitchenAid cups of similar appearance (although without the handy interior measuring marks). My advice, keep your receipt if you buy these. Or skip them and get the KitchenAid, which have a non-slip rubber ring on the bottom, another nice feature. And they won't crack in the dishwasher

I bought two sets to take advantage of the free shipping, despite the low reviews. (I plan to buy good sheets once they go on clearance at the end of the season...) When I took one set out of the package there was already a hole in it. Amazon replaced them, but when I washed them they feel like they are going to fall apart. The filled up the lint collector. I have red and green lint everywhere, even after washing them. You get what you pay for

"New" French White is Terrible!!!  Please DO NOT waste your money!

I have depended on my French White - the "old" style - for many years.  I went to buy a few new pieces for myself, but discovered that Corning has changed the design.  "French White" is now nothing more than cheap-cheesy-heavy-porous-breakable stoneware.  I saw many chips and even a crack in the display models.  STUPID Corning! They seem to have forgotten that Corningware was designed to be the smart alternative to that cheap-cheesy-heavy-porous-breakable stoneware!  PLEASE SAVE YOUR $$$

I have tried to like this pot - in theory it sounds great, but in actual usage, it is very problematic.  The non-locking handles are the chief drawback - you need to awkwardly hold them closed with pot holders while draining - and the acute angle needed to remove all the water inevitably means leaking hot water on to the holders and hence on you.  Back to the tried and true colander in the sink for me

Review of Metrokane Mighty OJ Manual Juice Squeezer
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Although I ordered the juicer in the color black, I received the product in white.  If not for the color I would have purchased it locally.  After approximately 6 months of satisfactory occasional use the juicer is no longer functional.  Some of the teeth on the gear that is connected to the press lever have broken off.  I had expected a product this simple would have lasted for years.  I am obviously totally disappointed

I thought I was getting a good deal with this deep fat fryer but the quality was really poor.  I used the fryer only once because the lid did not seal properly and I ended up with oil & water from condensation dripping down the side.  I returned the product and received a full refund.  The safety plug was hard to use and the basket size is too small for more than two people

I purchased a few of these for myself and friends. From the day I got my spoon spatula it was my favorite kitchen tool, especially since I could use it when making sauces or frying onions and veggies. One day when making a non-meat tomato sauce the handle simply broke off leaving the handle in my hand and the spatula in the pot. I wrote to OXO about this twice in the last 2 months with no reply and this is most frustrating to me. Anyway, I am now using a KitchenAid product which feels much more sturdy and KitchenAid responds to e-mails IMMEDIATELY

Harder than maple, huh?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The very first cut I made on this cutting board left a huge gouge in the surface.  Subsequent cuts also left deep marks.  For something that's advertised as being harder than maple, I found this to be very surprising.  Maybe it's the way it's put together?  All I know is that this cutting board is on pace to be the shortest lived ever in my kitchen.  Pretty much the only thing that I like about it is that bamboo is a renewable resource.  Good thing because at the current rate, I anticipate needing a new one very soon

Function Fails to Follow Form
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Like most reviewers, I found these glasses to be elegantly modern and sleekly minimalist.  Like a number of other reviewers, I found that one of my glasses leaked.  Unlike one other reviewer, I was unable to eliminate the water between the glass' walls in the microwave, and when I tried to do so the glass became very hot because of the steam produced.  To my mind, elegance of form can never compensate for a failure of functional design.  5 stars for form, 1 star for function:  2 stars total.

I got this pasta maker as a gift, and after the first use the knob used to set the thickness of the pasta broke off and so did a piece of the handle used to turn the rollers.  All it would make after that is a flat piece of pasta with varying thickness.  The company is going to charge me to send it to them and back, even if they decide to exchange the product, and all correspondences must be done by mail (no call-in number) so I'm not even hopeful for an exchange

Why did I try Proctor-Silex again??
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
After me first coffeemaker began leaking- and it was a realtively new proctor-silex 12 cup maker- I decided to try one of these "cute" single serve ones.  Why, oh why did I purchase this brand??  First, it does take around 3-4 minutes to brew a single cup of coffee or tea.  This seems like a longer time than most.  And now, after 2 or 3 frustrating weeks, it's leaking just like the old one did.  Not user error, as the water comes from underneath the coffeemaker.  Also, the coffee is not coming out as hot either, which causes me to wonder if it's the heating element...  Even though this one can use loose grounds or pods, it is not worth the frustration!  Try a different brand.  My sister-in-law has really enjoyed her Sensao!

When something says 'white' I sort of expect to get something close to the colour white. I ordered three of these plates but they are closer to beige. They also have an odd matte finish that made them seem cheaply. However, they are large plates and at this price, probably good for entertaining if you need quite a few. The large ones would be good for holiday meals - those times when you really need extra serving pieces that you don't use the rest of the year

The tumbler that I have is sold in various places as the '360-degree Dribble-Proof Tumbler', I am not sure if that is the same as the JMT401 but on paper the specs and features are the same.  It is not a good design for car use.  On the plus side I like the no-handle design and it has a small base which should fit most cupholders.  On the down side you need 2 hands to twist the lid open or closed.  Also the 'dribble-proof' design means that the mug has a very deep lip, and even when it is full you have to tip it far up and into your field of view to get the liquid flowing

We have owned this blender for about 3 years. If I had to do it again I definitely would not buy this blender. First, it is very loud.

Pretty Blender Shaped Paper Weight

This is our fourth new blender in the last three years.  My wife and I prepare one large smoothie everyday that has no ice, but lots of frozen berries, fresh fruit, etc. Nothing else goes in the blender. This blender looked nice and was so heavy it implied quality. It even worked great for a few months. Then one day the gear that delivers power from the base to the jar stripped right off. Now it is out of warranty. This is not simple to replace since the plastic/rubber piece separated from the steel shaft. We paid close to $100 for this thing so spending a couple of hours bringing it to someone who will charge $25-$50 to repair it seems like throwing good money after bad.

This was the single worst set I've ever used. If zero stars would be an option, that's what I would have chosen. The pot broke before we could even dunk a peice of bread into the cheese. While it was warming on the stand it came with, I heard a sickening crack, so I immediately (tried) to take it the pot off the stand. The ENTIRE bottom of the pot and split away from the side...and cheese oozed everywhere on my counter top.

OXO usually makes great things, this sifter does the job, but if you're making something large be prepared to be there awhile. It's very slow and after awhile your arm will start to tire. I would not recommend this sifter, just too slow for even making a small batch of cookies.

Incredibly Annoying!!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have never written an online review for a product before, but I am so annoyed by this dumb sifter that I just had to. I am not a "speed" baker of any sort, but I have four kids and do like to make birthday cakes, muffins, cookies, etc. My old sifter was so old it was getting flecks of rust into the flour, so I started looking for a new one. I chose this one after reading all the online reviews, and even though I saw that a few people found it slow, I was not prepared for how slow it really is! I just sifted 3+ cups of confectioner's sugar for cake frosting and it took over five minutes. As another reviewer said, in order to make it go faster I shook more vigorously and then had to keep changing hands because they got tired. (I have never ever been tired out from BAKING before, fer' pete's sake!!!) I'm not convinced that the people who designed this product have ever actually USED a sifter. I'm stuck with the thing now, I suppose, so I'll learn to just go slower. But it is literally about one tenth the speed of my old sifter - which was just your typical grocery store thing with a crank on one side. The one thing I really like is the caps for both ends - an innovation I'm surprised nobody else has come up with. But that doesn't redeem the product for me. In fact, if I can put my hands on another one of those old-fashioned ones (at a thrift store, maybe) I'll snap it up and put this new one in the Goodwill bin.

spotlifter or spot grinder?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought this product thinking that it would be better than the cordless spotlifter that I had previously owned. The "powerbrush" just grinds in the spot and water flow required to loosen the stain must be hand pumped a little squirt or more accurately a dribble at a time. The prevoius cordless spotlifter pumped large amounts of water under pressure and made the clean up much easier.

There's hardly any suction. I applied a full tank of cleaner on the carpet (which requires a little effort one squirt at a time), but it only sucked up a few drops of it.  customer service was helpful and had me return the product

I have had these for about 4 months (I own every size made), purchased to go with the other Kitchenaid pieces (in red). It is impossible to get these white again after using them to cut cheese, carrots or anything with any natural coloring in it. I have tried cleansers with bleach, sprays with bleach and, in desperation, straight bleach! Scrubbing doesn't work either. I finally got some wood cutting boards and wish I still had my so attractive other ones on the counter.

More problems than pluses
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought one and the plate that diffused the air was off center so it baked unevenly.  I called and was told it was a defect and would do a warranty exchange.  I was under the impression they would send it out but when I called, I was told I was supposed to send in $14.95 for shipping or I could give them a charge card and they would charge it again to ship out a new one and credit when I returned it.  The new unit I received has had problems with the digital timer displaying the timer but rather than  to have a short so rat her than do the return thing again I just used a manual timer.  It baked a bit more evenly and was fast but still needed to rotate pans. I just recently had a power spike that took out all electronics plugged in, including the oven but I doubt I will reorder this product.  Too unpredictible.

Bad Buttons, Short Battery Life
</Text>

<text>

Beautiful to look at, BUT, I agree with other reviewers that buttons are difficult to operate and don't even work sometimes, plus be prepared to change batteries every few months--ridiculous for something that uses TWO lithium batteries and is not in heavy, or even everyday use

I have several other silicone spatulas, and this Kitchenaid scraper is, by far, the worst I've used.  Most silicone scrapers are soft and flexible, but this one is very stiff and rigid, so you cannot scrape containers out very well at all.  Honestly, it doesn't even appear to be made of silicone.  Cheap grocery store spatulas work much better than this one.  Very disappointing

when this arrived I was very pleased with its quality-color-packaging -everything.Only problems is that after a short time using the plates I noticed scratch marks-dark ones in the center of the plates-I would guess from where people used their dinner knives to cut their food--very disappointing-as I was ready to buy the entire collection-glad i waited.

This product stands up to heavy use without fraying or melting. My only complaint, and it's a significant one, is the shape of the handle.  I find it awkward and clunky.  It's probably great for people with larger hands.  I've decided to replace mine with cheaper ones.

BUYER BEWARE! I agree with the other reviews, these plates are BEAUTIFUL! Great size and shape.  However, I used them for the first time last night at a dinner party and the bottoms of the plates and cups are so rough they scratched my solid oak, espresso stained table!  Each place a cup or plate was set that wasn't on a placemat there were small scratches left behind. If you always use a table cloth or have a granite or stone table they would be fine, but I wouldn't ever put them on a quality wood table again. Fortunately Amazon makes returning easy

This blender is very weak. It has a small blade that cannot pull down anything of substance and I had to stir even soft fruit in liquid or it would never get cut up -- just the bottom part of the mix spins around. I used this blender four times since August 2006 (when I bought it) to make 'smoothies', always with poor results. As the other reviewer said, the fruit stays lumpy. The little blades aren't strong enough. Yesterday I wanted to liquify some cooked potatoes for soup. Of course they are thick and starchy, but after the usual 'stirring' to get them to move through the blender, the speed buttons started to vibrate and I could smell the unit getting hot. I wasn't overworking it -- mainly pulsing and then running it for about 30 seconds. All of a sudden, it wouldn't work any more. It just burned out. If you actually cook and expect a blender to blend things, don't buy this blender. I'm going to see if Amazon will take it back. (Note: after I wrote this, I was told by Amazon that I had to get in touch with the manufacturer, which I could do because it was within 90 days of purchase. However, the company wants me to mail in the plug and $5 for 'shipping' to get a replacement, which obviously I don't want. Why would I want to pay $5 more for a product that didn't work the first time? Why would I want the product again at all? Amazon would have taken it back, but they wanted it returned in the box, which I threw out. I'm even more dissatisfied with this product now than when I wrote this review originally. Maybe I can make it into an interesting planter and sell it at a craft fair . . .

I suppose this will actually peel garlic, if you use it just right. Never, ever, ever get it wet. It will not work. Also, you must trim off both ends of the garlic, or it won't peel. And then, I still have to hand peel some of the more stubborn pieces. It's just not worth the money. If you look around, you can find much cheaper garlic peelers out there.....BUY THEM!

In the running for worst teapot ever...

</title>
<text>
<Text>
Yes, it is pretty. No, it is not a good teapot. I have made tea for over 40 years, in all sorts of pots, and this is right up there with the worst. It drips A LOT! Perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout. And no, it does not drip from the spout. Rather, lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot.  This happens with both fast and slow pouring, with full and near empty pots.  This teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot. Just too much mopping up

This is NOT Aubergine, a dark purple like the color of eggplant skin, but it is a light, bright purple.

Caveat emptor, unless you're color blind or really like bright purple

I bought this box about 4 months ago and stopped using it about 2 months ago. It turned out to be more work than just a regular box. At least you can wash out a regular box and start over clean. Good luck with completely cleaning all the poo crumbs from the sliding track and cheap gears. It gets to be a disgusting affair, more than with a regular box.

Well, it started off a fairytale.  This small vacuum has a lot of power.  Unfortunatley, I think I have permanant hearing damage from the volume of this vacuum.  It is EXTREMELY loud, it terrified my pets and I had ringing in my ears after using it.  It worked very well for about 6 months and then pooped out on me.  I'm not sure if the motor gave out or what, but the suction doesn't work even though the brushes still spin.  THE FILTER IS A PAIN!  I run a rabbit rescue and deal with a lot of pet hair, it just clogs up way to fast.  If you have a small apartment with merely area rugs, this might be ok, just make sure you buy some ear plugs.  YIKES.

When I received my set of Mini Springform pans I was very excited.  I couldn't wait to get started on some wonderful deserts.  And as expected the results were great.     Only after the first washing did the problems reveal themselves.  Not only did I notice rust on the release hinges, but the rims on the collars were warped.  At first I thought I could live with this, but a friend pointed out it could only get worse.     I am used to purchasing top quality kitchen equipment, but these definitely do not make the grade.  Admitedly the results of my first time use were great, but I just don't feel these pans will last.     I hate buying something and knowing I will have to replace it soon.  And that is exactly the way I felt with these pans

I purchased this after looking at all of the reviews. What a mistake! After using this to cook single cup servings of several types of rice, there was one thing in common - a huge mess. Even after rinsing the raw rice several times, the unit still spatters out to about a two foot radius. I may try it with a wet dish towel on top to contain the mess, or I may just stick it in the basement and forget about it

Sticky button

This carafe keeps beverages warm enough.  The problem I'm having is the push button on the lid sticking in the open position.  The instructions that accompanied the carafe address this issue, although they were written for a different model that has the push button on the top of the lid.  Despite following these instructions the push button still sticks.  To get the lid to close now after I'm done pouring I have to release the button and smack the top of the carafe.  Very poor design in my opinion.  I wouldn't buy another Zojirushi product based on this experience.

I have purchased this item twice. The first barely made it through a grill season and the second proved even less hearty. The grill gets too hot for the wire and it burns through leaving two pices of probe wire. There is no way to use this with a grill and get sustained use from it. The same is true of all brands.. Models sold as "wireless" are not wireless in terms of going from the meat to outside of the grill.  Somebody needs to figure out how to make this tool without the probe wire. That said, before it becomes useless, it works really well. Maybe the idea is to buy these by the case?

Keep Your Receipt

I've had 4 or 5 of these thermometers over the years and when they work they are great. But inevitably the probes fail. You will think its your fault and probably buy a new one. But the reviews show that the probes are not up to the temperature extremes they will be subjected to in a grill or an oven.

While it worked, it worked great.  But then it stopped working.  Only 10 months of use.  Ordered a new probe, but that didn't work.  Now, it's just an expensive timer.  Would've received three stars, but the Polder site and service not helpful.  Will try the Taylor model, good luck with analog Taylor thermometers.  Once you get used to these types of thermometers, it's hard to go back.  The precision in cooking, especially for chicken and pork, can make a big difference

I purchased this wok for my husband's Christmas present.  It was lovely, we cooked two meals in it Christmas day.  Nice heat transfer, beautiful on the table (but big).  That night, he noticed the handle was cracked where it meets the pan.  It's considerably narrower than the normal Le Creuset handle.  Back it went to Williams Sonoma, where there were a few other L.C. woks with similar cracks!  Phooey to you, Le Creuset.

We received 3 sets of this for a wedding present.  I really liked how the polished silver shined and how they felt in your hand.   However,  after just one wash there were quite a few that had rust spots.   After two more washes the rust got worse.  These are supposed to be dishwasher safe!  There are recommendations to hand wash these and dry them, but who has the time for that these days?  Despite the apeal of the set, we decided to try something else.   It's a shame because it's such a pretty set (before the wash of course!).

I bought two sets of these about 4 months ago.  After the first time in the dishwasher I noticed little tarnish/rusty looking spots.  They rubbed off fairly easily, but as time has gone by, they are looking very bad.  Tonight while eating, I got a sliver in my finger from the fork!  I have NEVER had a piece of flatware peel.  I'm going back to my old flatware.  Sure glad I saved it!  DON'T BUY THIS JUNK

We had this machine at work and made maybe 6 cups a day on a busy day. Within a month the machine broke - Keurig did replace it right away but then the second broke as well (a co worker bought one for his home and had the same problem!!). they gave us an upgrade on the model and this one is still going. The Coffee was good but the tea was not. Most importantly people is IT IS WASTEFUL. WITH LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS FILLING UP THE GARBAGE, AND IN OUR CASE TWO MACHINES IN THE DUMP. COME ON PEOPLE LETS HAVE SOME CONSCIOUS COMSUMERISM AND SLOW DOWN. What ever happened to putting the coffee in a paper filter and pouring hot water over it and letting the fragrance wrap around you. If you are that busy and needy for coffee instantly maybe you should be looking at the job ads or self help books and not over priced hunks of wasteful plastic for greedy americans

NOT non-stick, but otherwise a good pan
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought this pan because it was non-stick, plus it had the air cushion between the layer of steel.  I bake my usual brownies and cookies and they all stuck to the pan.  It stuck more than my glass pyrex casserole pans.  It was not easy to get it off, I had to scrape it off and it took time and a bit of muscle.  Definitely not non-stick.  The air cusion works from preventing the bottom of the cookies from overbrowning, which is not exactly a great idea since the top of the cookie become significantly more brown than the bottom of the cookie, which sometimes is moist and not quite holding the cookie together.

PLATES BREAK - 3 IN FIRST MONTH
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
We just replaced our entire kitchen dishware with the Sango Brown - Mistake...even bought the added pieces...well, we ONLY hand wash them (we have a dishwasher but rarely use it).  In the first week, a plate broke in half right down the middle...then a week later, a second...and tonight, a third..all three directly down the middle of the plate while HAND washing..(not rough washing either).  I have a call into Sango and hopefully they will resolve it.  After reading the reviews here, I would have to agree that its not worth the danger of broken dishes (My wife sliced her finger pretty good on the second broken one) to buy these.  I am going to try to find a set that will go with ALL THE EXTRAS I bought from Sango..I am HOPING I don't have to replace everything!  What a mess!  Sango, why cut corners on such a beautiful set??  Im at a loss here to figure out that business logic

These sheets are not quality. They are no way equal to the value that the seller has assigned to them. The jersey material is very thin and the construction technique is inferior. They are NOT a bargain

I wish it was possible to give less than 1 star!  Went through dishwasher once, came out rust!  Save your money....or your packaging!  I thought Chicago cutlery; how can I go wrong?  so out the packaging went!  I called Chicago Cutlery.  Turns out some of their stuff is now made in China. Wouldn't that make it China Cutlery?

cracked in the oven after 2 months

I was very pleased with the Le Creuset baking dishes I have (I have the Poterie 10" x 13" deep dish baker, 14" oval baker, and 9" square dishes as well as this one).  However, my 12" dish just cracked down the middle while I was cooking a pork roast in it at 425 degrees.  It had only been in the oven about 45 minutes.  I am sorely disappointed and now I am wondering if I wasted my money on the others.  I have only had it for about 2 1/2 months

Breadman 900S
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have owned this breadman for one year.  I make between one and two loafs of bread per week.  Mostly whole wheat bread.  I purchased the 900S because my previous machine was a breadman and it performed well (8 years).

Expensive baking pan

<Text>
Not sure how other people have been able to make a real loaf of bread with this, but I certainly could not.  I made three attempts, all failures for various reasons.  Either it did not mix, or the dough was so hard it knocked the pan off its base, or it created pebbles of dough.  It definitely can not be left unattended, which defeats the purpose of delay start.  It bakes OK though, but you better do all the upfront work yourself.  PS. I was using the recipes that come with the maker

A VERY BIG Warning
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
We liked the idea that the caraffe didn't need to be heated from below... a big plus with this unit.  But.... we have had some serious problems with the filter backing up and the water leaking over the top of it everywhere on the counter.  A FLOOD of coffee.  We thought that it might be the filter holes were clogged... so we made sure they were rinsed out well and could easily flow a stream through them.  But then we had a flood again on the counter.  So we thought that maybe our filters were'nt good... so we bought other ones.  And them we had another big flood of coffee (this has proven to be very staining to our white grouting).  So we thought perhaps we were grinding our coffee too fine and it was packing down too tight.... so we ground it coarser... and yet, ANOTHER DANG FLOOD. We have followed the instructions perfectly... and still these overflows.

Not Accurate and Potentially Dangerous
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
From the start, it was apparent that the temperature displayed was 5 or 6 degrees higher than two other digital thermometers I had in the same room.  So I followed the calibration instructions and was only able to get the display to read 34.1 degrees in a 32 degree solution... ok, so I can live with 2.1 degree inaccuracy.  After calibrating, the room temperature was also only off by about 2 degrees.  However, I decided to test it in boiling water and the display read 193 degrees (water boils at 212F).  So, If you are counting on this thermometer to tell you anything important (such as if your meat is cooked suffiently or if your beer water is the right temperature for steeping), I would make sure it is accurate at the temperature of interest before using... or avoid it all together, which I wish I had done

What a disappointment! And now I see that the regular price has been changed from $25 to $40. YIKES! Don't bother..

Broke Three In Quick Succession
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought three of these when I saw them in a local store, thinking them a great deal. They LOOK like the equivalent of the Henckels, solid and sturdy, at one-fifth the price. Looks can be deceiving. They are suitable for paper, skin, aluminum foil, etc., but do not try them on anything more substantial, like chicken leg bones. I broke these on items that I routinely cut through with my Henckels and Wusthof shears. The cost of sending them back under warranty was about the purchase cost, so I tossed out all three pairs.

This product is sick! If you get a "delight" out of seeing an fish hung  like a Christmas decoration in a ball that is way too small too  live in your sick! Plus a nightlight? Try sleeping w/ no eyelids w/ a light over your head. Fish sleep too, but  they cant close their eyes. There does not even seem to be much air space above the water. It's the same problem with those silly bowls with the plants on top. They breath oxygen and sufficate witout fresh air. Get at least a five gal. tank and don't waste your $ on this cheap fad product. Bettas are so smart, fun and sociable and desarve just as much respect as all of our fellow pets and humans

This mixer is so weak it couldn't mix air. It's horribly under powered. Seriously, it bogs down mixing mashed potatoes, and I'm talking INSTANT mashed potatoes! And mix protein drinks?? Forget about it. It leaves clumps because it doesn't spin fast enough. I'd do better twirling my finger in the glass.

Nice Concept - Poor Execution
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I agree with the other reviewers; had the machine for a couple weeks, after 5 uses the machine didn't sit right on the base, causing the teeth between the base and the container to grind a bit.  After that, it was all downhill.  The base teeth were completely ground down within 2 uses.  Interestingly, the new back to basics smoothie machines seem to have a better locking mechanism, and teeth that seem to be made of more durabe material

Smoothie No More - What a waste of good tequila!!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I had this machine for about 3 years with no issues. But, how often do most people use their machine?  I used it maybe 15 to 20 times.  I went to use it yesterday and all of a sudden I see smoke and the bottom of the machine and that funny electric smell (We all know what that smell means) The plastic bottom of the base stuck to the machine and margarita's were everywhere (except in my glass).  We had to throw the whole machine out.  Now I will be buying a new machine, being that I enjoyed the convenience of the spout but if I can't find one thats non plastic I will use my blender.  The smoothie maker makes less of a mess for drinks, a blender always doesnt pour as nice. I will not buy another plastic model again.  (I believe this one was a gift to me)  Do yourselfs a favor and spend the extra cash on a metal version or even glass if this exists, obviously the motor doesn't last long and the plastic parts break to fast according to other reviews I've read.

I bought the Back to Basics 600 smoothie maker about 6 months agos.  I was pleased with it until the plastic toggle on the spout broke.  It is made of plastic and apparently could not withstand the tension on the plug.  I was very disappointed since I use it every morning but thought it would last longer.  I will look for a better quality one next time

I am a quilter and was looking for a good hot iron and lots of steam. I also hate the auto- shut off. Well I thought I had found it. The perfect iron for my needs. Well after only one days use it is put away for someone else to use I was very disapointed in the iron it spits water and boy do I mean spit my ironing board cover was wet. My fabric continued to to roll under the iron, the surface is not smooth and seems to grap the fabric. Not what I was looking for at all I would not recommend this iron

Worst Iron Ever

</title>

<Text>
I have had this iron for awhile now.  The big problem is that gunk builds up on the soleplate that is almost impossible to get off. Except when you iron white shirts, when it seems to rub off of the collar and seams, permanently staining and thus ruining your shirts.  Avoid this iron at all costs

Defective Product
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I was very disappointed with the Cookie Maker Plus and I believe I bought a defective product. The picture on the front of the box shows the person's hand on the big button to make cookies, I had to use the small button at the top to get it to work and the big button to retract the plunger. I have used the Cookie Maker Plus 4 times... twice to make twice baked potatoes, once to make candy but the 4th time I used their recipe for Classic Spritz Cookies the machine died after 16 cookies. I switched the batteries and it produced 2 more cookies , then died again. I finished the batch by rolling them out and using a cookie cutter. The Cookie Master Plus could use major inprovement. Don't waste your money.
