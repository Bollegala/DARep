Picture this: Clark Gable and the whole passle of MGM stars and starlets!  Spins a great story, and all this in 1947, could be today, except they  dressed better. You will not forget the characterizations, especially  Sydney Greenstreet, eat your heart out Eddie Murphy, just a marvy little  film for all ages (God I love cliches!

VERY GOOD GHOST MYSTERY!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
"The Changeling" has become a little bit dated, however, it is still a very good ghost story. The film stars (George C. Scott) as John Russell, a composer who has lost his family in a tragic accident. He rents a large estate in order to compose his music. It is here that he encounters the ghost of a young boy. Why is the boy haunting the estate? Why is he making contact with John Russell? As the film moves forward, John Russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate the mansion.

Scared me away from the bathtub when I was 15!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
THis was the first scary movie I ever saw in the cinema, and it made a strong impression on me. The bathtub scenes were so eerie that I only took showers for a few years after I saw this movie at 15 - that is how much it scared me. I have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective, although I do have to say it is pretty scary and well done. Watching it many years later, I was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70's cheese that you see in many films from that era. The carpet and some of the clothes were funny, but it didn't detract from the film. Glad I bought it

<Text>
Apart from the emotional content due to the fact that a grandson defends his grandfather who is going to be executed for a racist crime, the films deals with the death penalty with great sympathy and ethical enlightenment. It also reveals with some silent moments here and there that the decision to execute the murderer is not at all taken for real moral reasons but only for political reasons. The governor finally gives the go-ahead message and refuses to pardon the murderer or even to stay the execution for some new investigation in some facts that appeared at the very last minute, and this under pressure from a crowd and he even announces his decision in front of this crowd and TV cameras. This is what is particular unbeareable about the death penalty : the final decision is always taken by some elected politician who turns it into his own political campaign  Just for that reason it is unethical. The film also reveals how the grandfather is transformed in just 28 days by the energy and dedication  of his grandson. He finally realizes, as he says so well, that he was not completely black and evil and that there must have been something good in him that he transmitted to his son who transmitted it in his turn to his grandson. There was a new hope in that man. But that was too late and that could not be taken into account by the governor.

A Movie Worth Buying
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I will begin by saying that this movie by no means touches on a new plot. The 'geek' boy falls in love with the alternative girl, while she's already fallen for someone else, who is a complete jerk. Of course, they end up together in the end. However, most movies are bought for the newness, the originality, and are watched once or twice and forgotten on a dusty shelf. This movie captures attention through other avenues. The characters are charming, and everyone will relate to this movie, and say 'hey, that sounds like someone I know'. Ths soundtrack is fabulous, and the movie includes a segment of a live performance by Everclear, that, although short, is very impressive. My advice: Rent this. If you like it the first time you see it, then proceed to buy it, because you always will. If you're not keen on it, then don't bother

Old-Fashioned Adventure Tale
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Here's an "epic" movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence Of Arabia. Interesting to note that Omar Sharif was in this modern-day movie and Dr. Zhivago. Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as "The Mummy." Well, it wasn't and it was way too slow for them.

One of the funniest series of the early '90s
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
For me, &quot;Get a Life&quot; provided plenty of laughs in its spoofs of what often manages to pass as television comedy, from Chris' unique effort to rehabilitate a collection of street punks to his discovery of a space  alien (in home video Volume 2) which is anything but cuddly. I only wish  Rhino would expand its offerings of &quot;Get a Life&quot; episodes

One of the very best thrillers of the 70s
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Juggernaut was more or less lumped in with the disaster movie genre when it came out in the mid-70s, possibly because the making of the film itself seemed so disastrous. Originally a Bryan Forbes film, Forbes was briefly replaced by Don Medford (who had also briefly taken over The Guns of Navarone after Alexander MacKendrick was fired and before J. Lee Thompson was hired) before Richard Lester took over. While it's easy to spot some of the typical Lester touches (such as poor offscreen jokes added during the dubbing sessions), it's so unlike most of his other films that you constantly find yourself wondering who directed what.

Groovin' With Pop Royalty
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Let's start with the negatives. This vid is too damn short. A half-an hour doesn't do justice to the title Groovy Gals. Where are the Marvellettes? Where is Brenda Holloway? Second, because the acts are taken from different  shows, Groovy Gals has no flow and a chopped quality that is only made  worse by shoddy editing. Third, host Jimmy O'Neill is really irritating and  useless on these tapes. Why not edit him out and give us more acts? On the  positive side, this tape has more rock royalty than you could shake a gold  record at! The Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, just nails The Shoop Shoop  Song with her gospel-spiced vocals, and mention must be made of The  Blossoms, led by the legendary and highly-underated Darlene Love. They back  up Franklin and a number of acts and look like they're really having fun  with I Like It Like That. Speaking of rock royalty, my personal faves, The  Supremes, glide through Baby Love with the style and sophistication that  made them Princesses of Pop. Ross has big hair and, with Flo and Mary, does  the slick, subtle choreography that tattooed them as Motown acts. A rare  treat is Ketty Lester torching out Love Letters. Wow! Watch her make the  word &quot;sign&quot; an eight-syllable word in song, and enounciate each  word. But the wildest was the last: The Acid Queen, Tina Turner,  electrifies with Ooh-Poo-Pah-Do. Tina in a tasteful cocktail dress and nice  pumps is jarring enough, but when she lets out the clutch and revs the song  up (Backed by The Blossoms who are clearly enjoying themselves) you will be  hard pressed to tear your eyes away. Other acts include The Toys looking  bored and jaded as they sit in a fake garden setting in Lover's Concerto;  Leslie Gore romping through Judy's Turn To Cry with Shindig's lame go-go  dancers; Fontella Bass with her one hit, Rescue Me; Great rare Shangri-La's  footage of Give Him A Great Big Kiss (such naughty shimmies!); Jackie  DeShannon's tender version of Burt Bacharach's What The World Needs Now and  Petula Clark showing too much Brit restraint with her monster hit Downtown.  Yes, the filming is b+w and strange at times, but if you love the time  period or the music this one is a necessary document for collectors and  fans. Enjoy

Whenever I'm Ready For Baseball Season
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Certain movies really capture the feel of their themes, and this one is the one movie that really captures the magic of Baseball like no other. Of course there is a great moral lesson to be learned. But haven't we learned by now, that the Devil has no good purpose in wanting to help us to achieve our goals? I hope so. What a great cast of performers. Nothing was lost from the Broadway stage in this production. And nothing is lost from the movie in this excellent transfer to DVD. Through the magic of Hollywood, when done to perfection, film can even enhance the story. And few have done the job with a Musical as well as this Gem. Thanks largely to the astounding talent of Bob Fosse's choreography. Tab Hunter's shining moment. Gwen Verdon's 'Whatever Lola Wants' is the showstopper, but Ray Walston steals the entire film as an extremely funny Devil. A film favorite for most of my life

Eventually, anyone who makes it their business to seek out quality horror movies is going to come to the conclusion that the ones that succeed in distinguishing themselves from the pack tend to fall into three distinct categories. First, you have the horror movies that are less interested in scaring you than they are seriously exploring their subject matter, and probing into the nature of evil. Sometimes, they go the supernatural route (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now). Sometimes, they stay grounded (Psycho, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Se7en). Either way, they are more disturbing than they are immediately frightening. You acknowledge that what you've seen has struck a kind of nerve, but you won't lose much sleep. These movies are  intellectually compelling but they do not provoke any immediate sense of terror.

This movie is almost 40 years old...can you believe it? To those of you who haven't seen this classic, my only question to you is, why? Why in the world have you been depriving yourself of something so incredible, so wonderful, so fun, so beautiful. It is just one of those movies that makes you almost kind of sad that we don't have filmakers and storytellers like we used to. We have become a group of people who are more interested in constant action, that we have forgotten how to tell a story. We have become a group of people who desire to be constantly stimulated rather than allowing ourselves to get interested and involved. If this movie was created in today's market - and it pains me to say this - it would be a box office flop.

Micky Dane (Robert Patrick), a paparazzo photographer, is on the run after a photo shoot that leaves him framed for murder. This movie has great action, good acting and really catchy music. Body Shot is another Robert Patrick movie that I've seen multiple times(probably about 12 so far and still counting).  You gotta love Patrick with his blond hair! I AM biased and give this a perfect 5 stars

The Great Battle of 1965
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This film is about the battle in the Ia Drang valley in 1965 Vietnam. It begins in 1954 when a French patrol is attacked and defeated in a surprise ambush. A prophecy for the future? In one scene a wounded French soldier is killed. [Was this truth or drama?] Then in 1964 we see children in a car singing a tune based on "Sambre et Meuse", which dates to the Napoleonic Wars. Next we see a training camp where helicopters will be used in ground battles. [Wasn't this an adaption of a civilian model?] One scene shows officer's wives discussing local conditions and the laundromat. [Are the defective washing machines at the camp a symbol of failure?] One scene recalls Custer's last battle. Custer did not know the size of the enemy; he assumed about 2,500 and not three times as many. Later we hear the Intelligence officer admit they did not know the size of the enemy forces. Ominous?

This is a nice love story, a little dumbed down, but with a great message, the money may be the root of all evil, and what is important is the human heart.  This is a message that is badly needed in a very materialistic world.  Nicholas Cage is one of our finest commercial actors.  He proves is versatility in this picture.   What ever happened to Bridget Fonda??

I just watched the second half of Guarding Tess on TBS. It's now 11:30PM, and I am writing this review when I should be in bed 1 and half hour ago. Nicolas Cade and The old woman in the movie both turned in great performances. The story was lightly funny at first, but didn't really go anywhere. The relationship between The FBI agent and ex-first lady was strange, and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation, it was still weird. The climax came at the end, and was very entertaining, for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot. There is much meaning in the movie; it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life. I was touched by the movie. Thank you. I should go to bed now

SHIRLEY SHINES
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
GUARDING TESS wouldn't be so much fun if it weren't for the presence of the unflappable Shirley MacLaine as the former first lady who gets Nicolas Cage for her secret service bodyguard.  Cage is equally effective in his role.  He hates his assignment and he and MacLaine don't get along well at all.  But when the President himself (voiced by director Hugh Wilson) insists on their pairing, what can Cage do?  Other than the expected pivotal kidnap plot, there's not a whole lot that goes on, but the film surprisingly shows what it must be like to surrender your privacy due to your notoriety and MacLaine's attempts to find such private moments is poignant.  A solid supporting cast makes it work too, although Edward Albert's character of MacLaine's son is rushed over too much to bring any significance to the role.  All in all, a pleasant enjoyable movie

as an asian american, i just want to say how well this movie is made.  i'm not offended that this movie casted caucasian actors (come on people, this was in the 1930s!!)  and yes, there are a few scenes that are not in the book.  but, let's count how many hollywood movies (taken from books) that can't hold a candle to it's original masterpiece.  i love the movie 'misery' but if you've read the book, the book outshines the movie by a landslide.  so yes, the good earth movie has scenes that are different than the original book, but still a very well made movie nonetheless, particularly for the 1930s.  i saw it on tcm and am looking forward to getting the dvd

...far more complex and feministic than the "girls and flapper fashions", would have you believe. Needs to be seen in it's entirity and revived for a modern audience as the series is now an overlooked gem. The leads are excellent and follow in the best traditions of such British historical series such as "Upstairs Downstairs". If you have never seen it you will not be dissapointed and the lead actresses are extremely good, both RADA trained and both have worked extensively with the Royal Shakespeare Company

This movie is great. I remember watching it when I was really young. Im 21 now and still love it. Yeah some things are corny but that is part of what makes it great. Its not suppose to be realistic. Its fiction! I just realized too that the daughter is the girl from American Pie which makes it even funnier. Overall this movie is pretty good. If you dont care for the story, atleast get it to see Kim and the other chicks in the movie. If you've never seen the movie, just buy it. Its about the same as renting it a couple times and you will be able to keep it. For all you people who rated it a 1 you have issues!

Jack London needs to be given his proper due. He is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors.

This outstanding and bold director has always paid special attention respect the dark side of the state of things; like in this case where a lawyer practically out of the game due the drink, decides to assume a delicate case of unorthodox medical praxis. Please notice how Lumet works with grayish tunes in the lawyer ' s office to accent his personal drama.

I Heart This Movie!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
What do an environmentalist, a firefighter and a chain-store executive have in common?  Quite a bit according to this joy of a film.  David O. Russell and Jeff Baena have written a highly intelligent comedy about a man who's trying to make sense of his life.  That man is Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman), a founder of a group called the Open Space Coalition who are trying to preserve forest and marsh area's where big business want to tear it down.  In his latest attempt he's joined forces with a chain-store known as Huckabees whose exec on the way up Brad Stand (Jude Law) seems to have a hidden agenda.  All this aside, Albert is troubled by a very tall African teenager that has crossed his path on three occasions and he is convinced this coincidence has substantial meaning in his life, so he seeks out the help of Vivian & Bernard Jaffe (Tomlin and Hoffman), two existential detectives, hiring them to follow his every move to decipher how his life makes sense.

We have all wondered what would happen if the Alien and Predator met...head-to-head.  This movie answers that question very well.  No cheesiness.  We have watched this movie so many times we have lost count, and we still watch it sitting on the edge of our seats or our knees to our chest.  Great Saturday evening movie

unflinchingly realistic look at Latina gang life in Echo Park
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
When I first saw this film, some five years ago, it truly knocked the breath out of me.  For the first time, director Allison Anders gives us a glimpse into Mexican-American gang life in East LA's Echo Park, from the female perspective, this time.  In the past, we have seen our share of male experiences (example being Zoot Suit, written by the playwright Luis Valdez).  For once, we see the gritty side of the gang life, as young Mexicanas (or Chicanas, depending on who you ask) struggle to stay alive, amidst rampant drug dealing, the violence of gang initiation and their relationships with men who are less than honorable to them.

This dvd brings me back to when I was growing up in the 70's. I am happy to share this with my kids.  Who can forget the baby puppets in the hospital window trying to figure out if they are boys or girls or Rosie Greer singing "It's Alright to Cry."  One of the highlights is the duet by Roberta Flack and a young Michael Jackson singing "You Don't Have to Change at All."  I am so happy I am able to have this piece of my childhood to share.

who's having a baby?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
BIG fan of 80's... music and culture, and most of all The Movies.  she's having a baby is not just a teen movie like "sweet sixteen" or "breakfast club".  Its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day.  Soundtrac is great with kate bush "the woman's work".  My girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played.  i told her i'll feel the same if she were the wife.  boy i got lovin that nite... i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby, i thought it was clever.

I begged to see this movie in 1985! I was only 14 but I knew I had to see it and buy the soundtrack. (remember cassettes?)  Never has Rob Lowe or Emilio Estevez looked better! Hot, Hot, Hot!!  No this isn't Oscar worthy or anything, but if you are a die-hard 80's Brat packer, this is the one!

This movie will make you laugh and cry with a who's who of hollywood.  The music alone will move you to the kleenex box.  If you have lost someone to aids, this movie will touch you deeply.  I was told not to watch this movie alone.  Watch it with someone to hug.  How right they were.  Bronson Pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have.  Eric Roberts and Gregory Harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples I know.  Bravo!  Get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect

Like Callanetics, this DVD concentrates on the slow movements--you really MUST tuck, you really MUST curl up, or else this DVD is ineffective.  Unless you can shut off the phone and close the door on the kids, the amount of concentration this DVD takes for getting one's posture absolutely correct, tucking just right, is not feasible.

Whenever people hear of Sofia Coppola they think of 2 things: her much-maligned performance in Godfather III, and her famous dad Francis Ford Coppola, director of the Godfather films and Apocalpyse Now. The latter is particular fodder for nepotism remarks, although it's not as if her dad has made some stellar movies lately. "Jack" anyone? Well this film and her next film Lost in Translation should tip the scale on her favor as she's quite perfect for this kind of material.

Just plain wonderful character study
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Peter Dinklage may be the one of the most unlikely sex symbols ever to assay the role of A Stranger Comes To Town, but that's part of what makes this charming character study so offbeat and unforgettable.  As Finn, a dwarf who has just inherited an abandoned train station in Newfoundland, NJ, Dinklage carries the story on his small but exceptionally sturdy back, never begging the audience's sympathy but conveying worlds of anger, hurt, bewilderment and amusement in his dark eyes.  (His rumbly, seductive voice doesn't hurt either.)  As a local resident with a tragic past, Patricia Clarkson adds to her litany of complex women characters (and provides some of the film's biggest laughs when behind the wheel of her SUV), with stellar support from a garrulous Bobby Cannavale and a luminous Michelle Williams.  Settle into the film's gracious, generous rhythms and prepare to feel absolutely wonderful

Another Wayne/Ford Compilation
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Many people know about John Wayne and John Ford's cavalry trilogy, three of the greatest westerns ever made, but another pairing between the two is not as well known. The Three Godfathers is a lesser-known John Wayne classic when he was at the top of his game.  Starring Harry Carey Jr. and Pedro Armendariz as the other two godfathers this classic should not be missed.  These three outlaws ride into the desert after a bungled robbery only to find a dying woman with a newborn infant.  The Duke promises to care for the baby which she names Robert William Pedro Hightower after the three outlaws.  They must then make the trek across the desert with very little supplies to get the baby to the next town.  Excellent supporting cast with many recognizable faces from other Duke movies, with Ward Bond playing the sheriff who attempts to track down the outlaws.  Truly funny scenes as Wayne, Armendariz, and Carey attempt to care for the baby.  As usual awesome scenery as is expected in John Ford westerns.  This is one classic that has to be put on DVD.  A must have for John Wayne fans

Ever dreamed of having a mermaid as a girlfriend?

"Splash" is without a doubt among the top romantic comedies of the 80's that has truly stood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it was back then. I actually saw this movie when it was first released, which is rare for me since I was only a kid back in the 80's and hardly saw any movies in the theater in those days. I first bought it on VHS, eventually upgraded to the bare-bones DVD, and now have upgraded yet again to this 20th Anniversary Edition DVD. I just can't get enough of this movie.

Superb Bardem Galvanizes Painterly Look at Reinaldo Arenas
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Spanish-born actor Javier Bardem gives a staggering performance as Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas, which is lucky since he is in almost every frame of this film. In fact, he is the only constant in a biopic that sometimes feels disjointed and a bit long-winded, piecing together as it does the various episodes of Arenas' life sometimes sacrificing narrative flow in the process. At the same time, this is a powerfully moving film that displays the intensity of the post-revolution persecution experienced by Cubans more effectively than either Carlos Eire's memoir, "Waiting for Snow in Havana", or Hollywood confections such as Sydney Pollack's "Havana" or Richard Lester's "Cuba".

Terrific movie. Matthew Broderick makes you believe that he is a high school social studies teacher with every step he takes and every rhythm of his speech ("Good luck, there, Tracy"). Reese Witherspoon can't be accused of underacting her part, but that's the fun of it. She is hilarious as the high school overachiever who doesn't care who she steps over (or on) to succeed.

A haunting and disturbing movie drama when it first came out
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have read a number of good reviews of this DVD on this site, especially the one written by Dennis Littrel. I will thus only add a small personal impression. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and being troubled by the sight of the 'good guy' so disturbed and unsure of himself. This is not what we were expected to see from Western heroes. Also troubling was the possibility that the good guy somehow might not win. Also troubling was the involvement of the good guy with another woman in a way which could not be understood by a very young person. If he had a fiancee then what was he doing with this elderly Mexican woman?

</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
HA!  Great movie, plot, performances and insights!  Gotta see this one, at least once, for experiencing a truly under-rated masterpiece.  My main reason for writing is the inane comments here and fear with reality that pervades our society.  Those who can't, don't or won't appreciate (at least) the marvelous, insightful messages here are possibly the very ones that assure nothing will ever change much .  Scary to shed light on bare essence of humanity's inhumanity and its inability to rise above the systematic base obsessions of power, control and coveting; whether rationalized with all the reasons that endorse continuing to man's lower instincts or from fear of looking beyond the security of ignorance.  It is amazing that the natural order of things may be better balanced and have a wisdom beyond anything man may attain, as he seeks to control nature and fellow man while failing miserably at controlling himself, even with all his knowledge and tech, to a point equal or beyond the inherent natural wisdom of (so called)lower species.

I was contemplating on getting the Director's Cut of Gone in 60 Seconds until I looked at the time length.  Usualy a director's ct has more added to it, not taken away.  Believe it or not but the Original; released version of Gone in 60 is 118 minutes long where the Director's Cut release has a minute less footage.  For those that don't care it's not a big thing, but for movie goers, a minute off takes alot away...  Unless you're in it for the new extra features

This movie came out when I was twelve and I have been in love with it ever since. It brought me, a rural farm kid, the magic of Leonard Cohen, Concrete Blond, Was (Not Was),The Beastie Boys, and all of the other wonderful musicians who grace this film. It also brought me Christian Slater in a role that I would later relate to in a big way as a teen. In short, for reasons all sentimental, I love this film. It may not have cohesiveness in the same way "Heathers" does but it has heart and that is something that teen movies seem to lack these days. So watch this flick and be grateful that you are no longer in high school. I know I do

Slater gives a flawless performance and his best ever
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
this movie is about Christian Slater (Heathers, True Romance) who plays Hard Harry the pirate radio man of his pirated show. this is a movie that deals with rebellion and teen angst..kids who want to live their lives free of all the things they are imprisoned to do and they tune into Slater's show everynight to listen to him speak it loud and proud. Samantha Mathis' (Broken Arrow, That Thing Called Love) film debut...this is number 1 out of the 3 movies her and Slater star together in. Cheryl Pollack (My Best Friend Is A Vampire) is hotter then ever. Slater's flawless performance and unforgettable moments make this one a masterpiece and a movie not to be forgotten, one of the best movies of 1990. Also starring Mimi Kennedy (Tv's Dharma and Greg), Scott Paulin, Andy Romano, Ellen Greene (Talk Radio) and Billy Morrisey (Severed Ties) co-star. note: Seth Green (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Party Monster) has a short but recognizable role in here and so does Martin Landau's daughter Juliet Landau (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Ed Wood).

SO TOUCHING!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have to confess that I went to tears watching thIS movie, and usually I don't get emotional easily. It's so touching, a PhD professor of middle age find out that she is sick. Ovarian cancer. It was a shock for her, the doctor is talking to her and she can barely react. All through the movie, she looks at the camera from time to time and tell us all what she is thinking and suffering. There is a "brilliant" young doctor (yes, one of those who always wants to be the first and the best no matter what, with a big ego, the big shot of the class) who was her student in one of her literature classes. It made me very angry, his attitude, because he was treating her in a very cold and selfish way, only thinking in the results of the research. I want to say that most of the doctors and scientists are not that way. But once in a while you can find one of these.... weird specimen. The nurse was nice and treated her in a better way. This kind of movie makes us think about the fact that we are all just humans, not matter the title or knowledge you can have. And we are here to help each other, no taking advantadge of each other. I strongly recommend this movie...just be sure to have a box of facial tissues near you.

Wow, let me start off by telling you that I had this video personally when I was younger.  I would ask for it constantly, and can still remember having it and watching it everyday. It really helped me learn and the drawings are great! Somewhere in the process of 'growing up,' the video was lost and I'm still upset about it. I'm not ready to have kids myself, but I know that when I do, I definitely want to re-purchase this video! It's so great to have things like this to help your children start learning at a young age and I recommend it to everyone. :

A Possible Future???

This is a rather scary look at what could be a possible future if things continue the way they are heading. Our food supplies becoming more depleted due to unfavorable growing conditions, climatic extremes, lack of water and nutrient-poor land as well as overpopulation continuing at an uncontrollable and alarming rate.  This type of recycling may become a necessity.  Hopefully, it would at least be voluntary as the movie depicts.  An eye-opener for sure

A Classic Not to be Missed
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is by far my favorite version of this classic story and the most authentic and true to the spirit of the book.  The cast and direction are excellent and the setting is gorgeous.  This film will delight both children and adults with it's adventure, suspense, and innocent romance.  It's a little spooky in some scenes, but of the fun rather than truly scary kind.  This story has a very positive underlying message but doesn't preach, rather it expresses it in subtly beautiful ways as the characters unlock the mysteries of the Secret Garden and of themselves.   No matter what age you are, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, uplifting, perhaps even transformative film - don't miss it

Nuclear Paranoia From A Master
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This 1955 release is one of those smaller Akira Kurosawa films that is overlooked in favor of his bigger films like &quot;Rashomon&quot; and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; but it's still worth seeing. The great Toshiro Mifune plays an industrialist in post-World War II Japan who is slowly going mad with the notion that a nuclear war is coming and tries to convince his family (and his mistresses) to flee Japan with him. Mifune's obsessive portrayal is the stuff of great tragedy especially as he vainly pleads with his greedy family to leave and Takashi Shimura, the samurai leader in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, is also effective as a counselor who tries to help straighten the mess out.    The movie captures Japanese dread about the atom bomb, a subject Kurosawa would also treat in his masterpiece, &quot;Ikiru&quot;, very well and with the greedy family closing in on a raving patriarch, brings to mind &quot;King Lear&quot;, a tale the director would go back to many years later in &quot;Ran&quot;. This is a small film from one of the world's great directors but a very good one

I really like these tapes.  The first one is pretty easy, but it is very relaxing, and i use it on days when I want to take it easy.  The second one is somewhat challenging, and the third one is even more so.  These tapes are a great guide from a beginning level to a more advanced one.  Tracy Rich is a very good instructor and makes you feel comfortable.  I also like how they (Ganga White and Tracy) show different versions of the poses with one being more advanced

If it has a weakness, its that its played so dryly, its almost like non-fiction that just happens to be funny.  Thank god for Fred Willard who adds some vitally important crassness to these "serious" proceedings.

A generic but entertaining adventure

"El-Hazard: The Magnificent World" is an anime very much in the "Tenchi Muyo!" mold: a romantic comedy/adventure in which blank-slate protagonist Makoto is thrust into a sci-fi scenario and gets to play hero while being chased by multiple women. Though the characters in "El-Hazard" aren't developed as deeply as the "Tenchi" crew and the show occasionally suffers from awkward pacing, "El-Hazard" has a charm all it own. The mysterious antiheroine Ifurita is compelling, and the kids' hard-drinking teacher Fujisawa is consistently funny. Most impressively, "El-Hazard" tells a complete and satisfying story, tying up its seeming plot holes with an ingenious last-episode twist. Usually these types of shows start strong, only to end up limping through anticlimaxes and false endings. Even the romantic tension is unambiguously resolved!

Terrific movie. Matthew Broderick makes you believe that he is a high school social studies teacher with every step he takes and every rhythm of his speech ("Good luck, there, Tracy"). Reese Witherspoon can't be accused of underacting her part, but that's the fun of it. She is hilarious as the high school overachiever who doesn't care who she steps over (or on) to succeed.

A documentary about the making of a film that never got past the shooting of a couple of scenes doesn't seem to promise much, but the story of what was to turn out to be a real-life "disaster movie" is riveting stuff.

This movie has great casting. The actors play characters that they usually don't play. This may be the best acting I have ever seen Keeanu Reeves do

It's hysterical and pitiful that some of the other 'reviewers' describe this program as though it is some subversive, dangerous, dogmatic propaganda.

I must say that I am generally not interested in watching a romance movie, but this movie is a definite exception. It "Possessed" a great soundtrack that fit the scenes perfectly, captivating scenery that is incredible, and a cast that perfectly fits the mold of the story. From beginning to end it was an absolute success of a complete movie. It piques the curiosity, it warms the heart, and it even manages to make you feel slightly better about life after watching it. buy it, you won't regret it

Watch and learn from this prison survival video

Justice in the criminal justice system? What is that but empty talk in the real world? IN HELL shows how an innocent man who honorably slays his wife's murderer finds himself brutally thrown into prison where he learns how to survive in the harsh system. No macho Van Damme kickboxing here, but a portrayal of his progressive instincts in an environment of hate. A true portrayal of life in today's world that is infected by faulty institutions who jail innocent men, and corrupt power brokers who run them.
