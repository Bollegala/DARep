One of the most interesting books I've ever read!  I could not put this one down.  If all economics books were written this well, everyone would want to be an economist!  The author has a unique perspective on the analysis of data that is very compelling.  He will make you question every "fact" you've ever heard and observe the world around you from a different angle

If you're into reading memoirs, this is exceptional.  Her clarity of thought and her ability to portray her feelings into words is unsurpassed, in my opinion.  I enjoy her prose so very much.  I can find myself relating to so many of her feelings and thoughts despite the difference of age and time.  This is a great read

Geez.  Its a book folks.  Nobody said it was going to be perfect.  Granted the sentence structure leaves alot to be deisred but use your imagination.  Draw upon your inner child and immerse yourself in the story and stop worrying about the piddly things.  If you want to read books then read them and enjoy them.  If you want to EDIT them then go be an editor.  We live in a world where people sell drugs that kill our kids for money and your worried about this guy making a few bucks with a writing career?  It's called priorities people, get some.  I say he should continue to write and see what he becomes.

Emotional Intelligence 10 years on
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
There is about as much additional science in Social Intelligence, compared to Emotional Intelligence, as you could write on a postcard : mirror neurones and spindle cells.   Nevertheless, we can be thankful that Daniel Goleman chose to pay his tax bills this way.  Firstly, it serves to bring back the lessons of the earlier book to best-seller awareness, which is goodness.  Secondly, it re-casts them more clearly in an inter-personal format.  Note that this already existed in Emotional Intelligence, but was not so clearly called out.

Pure Hiaasen
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Carl Hiaasen, who pens a weekly column for The Miami Herald, certainly follows the adage "Write what you know." While he occasionally covers nationally significant events, Hiaasen generally confines his writings to the fertile territory that is the state of Florida. Readers of Hiaasen's columns know well his passions and viewpoints. His sarcastic commentaries often take aim at such topics as the medical profession, land developers, crooked politicians, gun aficionados, tobacco companies, madcap theme parks and the destruction of Florida's environment. But weekly newspaper pieces are not the end of Hiaasen's caustic observations --- they are only the beginning. In 10 novels written over a span of 20 years, Hiaasen has expanded upon all of these topics in hilarious tales that poke fun at every aspect of life in the Sunshine State.

Changed attitudes!!

Excellent, realistic, practical advice.  As parent of a very strong-willed two-year old, I continually found myself in a power struggle with him over EVERYTHING!  After reading this book in a couple of hours, I immediately began implementing the techniques (which are very common sense and SIMPLE), and now, just a couple of months later, I have a totally different relationship with my little boy.  I no longer feel like I am controlling him all the time, he is happily independent in ways we are both comfortable with.  This book really changed my life.  BTW, I had previously read the original Love and Logic for older children, which I liked, but it recommended spanking for children under 3.  This did NOT help!!!!!  This book recommends no spanking, but withdrawing all attention empathetically, which is what my pediatrician recommended, which actually works

Dale Carnegie is one of the authors I have admired for so long. There are numerous reasons why this book is a classic one. He deeply believes that in every person there is good and you can approach it. Of course, there are many negative people who don't like this book because they see everything in black and white. Carnegie on the other side advocates a really delicate, positive and humane approach to everyone around you. It comes very close to "treat the others as you want them to treat you". I am sure that if everyone read and apply the principles in this wonderful book, the world will be a better place. I am sure that you will be pleased as well with his talent to really understand what drives people. Some of the key and basic motivators he discussed are sex and being important. His viewpoint is very close to the one of the bestselling author of scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. After all genius things are usually simple. Carnegie explores the human nature and common hot buttons together with the reader and gives you tools to manage and push them at your will with the help of numerous examples. I liked that the book is practical, easy and fun to read, and most of all that it delivers great value. I can not say the same for many other books. Definitely get a copy especially if you are a "good" person and prefer to treat people with respect and dignity

The ending will send chills up your spine and you get closer and closer to the Dark Tower.  The journey, the roses, Roland, the history... King is one of the masters!

Will There Be Pi in The Sky By and By When You Die?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Barrow, an astronomer at the University of Sussex when this book was published, provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics.  Do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics?  What 'reality' do mathematical entities like pi have?  What accounts for what physicist Eugene Wigner has called, in a now-famous paper, &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences&quot; (299)?  After an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers, Barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism, inventionism, intuitionism, and platonism, a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor.  Perhaps most mathematical workers follow what Alfred Korzybski called &quot;the 'christian science' school of mathematics, which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed `scientific' activities&quot; (Science and Sanity 748).  I commend Barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly.  Barrow's discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations.  As for Barrow's conclusions, from a non-aristotelian view, the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification, the confusion of orders of abstracting.  Barrow doesn't seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics.  He seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as high-order abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him.  As Korzybski pointed out, we live in a world of multi-dimensional, ordered structures or relations.  It does not seem unreasonable, then, that we can map this world with an exact language of relations, i.e., mathematics.  But as Korzybski also pointed out many times, &quot;the map is not the territory.&quot

My favorite part was the story of the "Golden Pages" where a person is taught by the wise man that truth of man's existence is inspiring and worthy of discovery, but to share that truth with others is subjecting oneself to ridicule and criticsm, if not war

You Can't Go Wrong with Larry Gonick
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have been a fan of Larry Gonick`s work for years ever since I first stumbled onto his Cartoon Guide to Statistics.  He covers a subject the way it should be covered-historically.  Innovations in science and math have moved along together in a historical time line.  It was this historical approach that made Carl Sagan's Cosmos series one of the greatest innovations in the effort to popularize science.

I remember my father giving me this book when I was young.  He was a junior high school english teacher and used this book in class.  Together we read the stories and I loved them.  Now I am a college professor and use the book in class myself. While some of the summaries are "dated," they are still useful in communicating the basic action of the play to students and the very fact that they are "dated" allows the book to serve as an illustration of how interpretations of Shakespeare's plays have changed since the Lambs' time.

If you are in the computer business, or in sales, you already know the Dell story. It's about a driven man, Michael Dell, who came up with a simple idea - direct sales - and then expanded his company into the world's second biggest manufacturer of personal computers. Dell's personal story is inseparable from the story of his company, and his book gives readers his unfiltered, first-person perspective. He covers his company's history, challenges, problems and successes in an unvarnished, matter-of-fact style. We highly recommend this book to anyone in the computer industry, to entrepreneurs and to managers who want to make their small businesses grow

The characters are Tom, a Navy seal specializing is counter terroism home on medical leave visiting his uncle, and Kally, a big-city doctor caring for her terminally ill father.  Sounds like a typical match for a romance novel, but this novel is so much more than that.  Kelly and Tom have a past, but her father and his uncle has an even bigger past.  All four of them have to draw on their pasts to protect the futures of themselves and many others.  Many long kept secrets must be bared and all their hearts must mend.

Jules Gets Four Stars
</Text>

<text>
<Text>
Suzanne Brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in.  The "mystery" portion of the story and the romance between Jane and Cosmo left a little to be desired.  I really didn't understand why Jane had to have her alternative personality as Mercedes and Cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened SEAL persona.  These particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to Jules and Robin, who clearly stole the show in this book.

I love the descriptions that the author gives for each exercise.  The author also color codes which exercises to do for each level of training.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is first starting out with free weights.

As a prospective college student, I have to tell you how much I appreciate Students' Guide to Colleges. It combines many of the best features of the Princeton Review and Fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness. I also appreciate that it is without any trying-to-sound-hip blather because these are not editor-interjected profiles, they're written by actual students. This is a great compliment--I have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year, and this is the best guide to colleges among the many I've seen. I also just read the Oberlin College profile in this book with an Oberlin alum and relative. She said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate Oberlin portrayal she's read in a guide. Among other things, she and I loved the different student perspectives and the unthinkable-in-previous-guides questions like "what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour?" The guide's honesty also impressed me, as the Fiske guide lauded Vassar's "diversity," for example, where Students' Guide admits "Although Vassar likes to talk about diversity a lot, most students are actually wealthy and white." I am confident in saying that anyone applying anywhere from Hampshire to Harvard will find this book incredibly useful!!

The Greatest Book on John Lennon
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The original publication of _The Lives of John Lennon_ in 1988 was accompanied by hysteria.  Much of it emanated from Yoko Ono, who likened Goldman's book to "being punched in the face."  Yoko is a close friend of Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine, which duly ran an article attempting to discredit Goldman's book.  Some of Lennon's fans took this behavior in and assumed that _The Lives of John Lennon_ was forbidden; they would not read it because doing so would make them naughty.

All the world's children have the same wants and needs
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I am a Lutheran church librarian and I am glad I bought this very satisfactory book for our church library.  Its text stresses that children are the same the world over.  They have the same feelings and needs, and have the same hopes and dreams.  The illustrations are a nice change from the usual.  Each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded.  The illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor, drawn in Persian style.  The colors are very saturated.  The book's cover gives you an idea of what they look like.  The message of this book is one of diversity--that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities, races, ethnicities, languages or faiths, they still have the same hopes, dreams and daily needs.  This is a very important message for children to hear in today's world where there is so much suspicion of those we "perceive" to be different.  The more children realize that kids are the same everywhere, the more tolerant they will be.  Children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age, say researchers, so you have to nip it in the bud very early, and this book does that in a wonderful way.

Angels was the smallest college in Cambridge.  It was  built at the beginning of the 15th century.  Fairly had a fellowship.  St. Angelicus students had to find their own lodgings.  Fred Fairly had taken the science tripos and received a first class degree.  He came from a rectory and so his material wants were limited.  He was used to making do. At the end of his first year as a junior fellow he wanted to tell his father he was no longer a Christian.  Fred knew the country was not a place of peace.  The Rectory had been built in 1830.

An Inspiration and a Joy
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I am a photographer and a writer and the author of numerous books on photography and I have had a copy of the Sierra Club Engagement Calendar on my desk every day for more than 20 years. I find this calendar to be an inspiration in terms of both its beautiful photography and its wonderful geographic diversity. I've never had a photo published in the Engagement book, but I've probably gathered more inspiration and ideas from these little calendars than from the hundreds of how-to books in my office.

My son chose his school here

<text>
<Text>
My son had visited several colleges, and was having a terrible time figuring out which ones he would "fit in" and get the best educational experience from. He ended up reading this book and visited a few of them that he liked the descriptions of. After applying to, and getting accepted at, four of the schools in this book (and two not in the book) he ended up at Denison University. He's in his second year, and just loves it. I've always felt a little "indebted" to this book, so I thought I'd leave this review

I originally bought this for my almost-2-year-old because I wanted him to have a new alphabet book with both upper and lower case letters shown (there are not many out there besides chicka chicka boom boom). Instead it has become a favorite of my three year old who already knows her letters. The reason: this book shows the letters and has beautiful illustrations of many items in one picture that begin with each letter. Some things are easy to find in the picture and others are more challenging. It is a beautiful book that provides "I spy" and "Where's Waldo" type challenges. I highly recommend this book for the 1-5 crowd

Finally, no more "Lousy and Ridiculous" for chemistry graduate students
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
As a recent grad of an org chem graduate program who had to suffer through the nearly 20 year old text "Mechanism and Theory in Organic Chemistry" by Lowry and Richardson, this book by Anslyn and Dougherty is a fabulous update that is easy to read and great asset to any chemistry student.  I agree with the other reviewers that the problem sets are challenging, the text is clearly written, and the material relates well back to current research issues. If you are a graduate student considering getting another reference to help you through your organic chemistry graduate program, get this book before you try "Advanced Organic Chemistry: Structure and Mechanisms" by Carey and Sundberg. I expect that "Modern Physcial Organic Chemistry" will become a staple to most chemist's shelves similar to that of a CRC Handbook or "Advanced Organic Chemistry" by March.

Line by line, this book has some of the best writing I've seen in a while.  This is an amazing thing, since it's still very fast-moving and not at all overwritten.  The author just has an amazing eye for detail and a very crafty sense of humor.  The book surprised me constantly with its insights, and these characters were so real to me by the end that I missed them for a week.  I read Craig's first book, and it doesn't stand up to this at all.  It's exciting to see how much the writer has improved, and I can't wait for the next one

I've gotten through about 1/3 of the book and I'm highly amused.  The first 50 pages are muddled and rather pointless so far.  However, I've laughed my way through them.  One thing Eco has is a very sophisticated sense of humor.  If you enjoy a mental challenge and writing that's loaded with wit, I'd suggest picking up this book.  I never knew there were four kinds of people before: morons, fools, lunatics and cretins.  And I may just be a fool.  :)

If you have been freezer cooking for awhile or are completely new to it you will enjoy this book because it has a different spin on freezer cooking than the classics. I started with Once-a-Month-cooking and at the time it seemed revolutionary, but, though I loved it was a hard days work. Then came Jill Bond and she was really talking bulk cooking! When Deborah's first book came out I was excited because it fit in with my low-on-cash, short-on-time lifestyle.

I had eyed this book for quite some time before I purchased it, and I am so glad I did!  The pictures of the drinks are so tempting and beautifully done that you are warmed up just by flipping through the book!  Most of the recipes in this book are alcohol based, so don't pick this book up looking for lots of kid-friendly drinks (though there are definitely some that kids would enjoy, such as a s'mores hot chocolate).  The recipes are all simple and there is a nice section on creating garnishes.  Order this book and get ready to sit back and enjoy some tasty, piping hot drinks

An excellent description on the role of the state
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is an excellent book on the role of the state after a revolution, how it will wither away, and what a society should look like ( or try to mould itself into ) after the revolution.  Lenin, drawing on the works of Marx  and Engels extensively, refutes many claims by both the Anarchists and  opportunists on the role of the state, and corrects many common errors  believed about the Marxist road to Socialism.  This is a thoroughly  informative read.  I recommend those wondering how a Communist society  would emerge after a revolution to get this book;  It will open your eyes  widely

This book is a great thing to have for anyone involved in the world of theatre.  It does the hard work of picking out a crucial 16-bar piece of a song for you!  Great for auditions.  The book has selections from musicals (old and new, familiar and rare), as well as movies (even some Disney!).  There's one for every vocal part.  Granted, not every piece is exactly 16 bars.  Some go a bit over, but this is usually excusable due to proper phrasing.  It's well worth looking into for those who are just starting out.  It's also a way of introducing yourself to a variety of musicals

Masterpiece of Western fiction.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Big Sky is not just a masterpiece, it's probably THE masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction.  This is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that isn't really dealt with that much - the Rocky Mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 - 1850.  The cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature, partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us: the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in "cowboy" movies mirror our own experiences in many ways.  The cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to Americans, when actually nothing was further from the truth.  Cowboys were regular working stiffs, about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day.  They didn't consider themselves "free", nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day.  They did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage, and there was a bit of swagger to it - people in town recognized cow hands for the tough-as-leather men they were, especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had.  But it was backbreaking work, and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years.

This is a great compliment to the more project-based MAKE magazine, as it focuses a little more on the personalities of the "makers." Of course, it also describes (and shows, in beautiful photographs), their projects, but it's a great way to see into the personal side of the amateur engineers, bored brainiacs, and fringe-worthy souls who are the heart of the newest form of the DIY geek culture: creating incredible, real-world projects, from the mega (a home built submarine for 3) to the micro, (a diy bat detector), to the whimsical (a Lego blocks project that will solve the Rubik's Cube).

Excellent book - like any good book on the subject you need to read between the lines
</Text>
</title>
<text>

I thought this was an excellent book.  Those who say this won't turn you into a champion overnight, I've got news for you - NO book can do that.  Only you can...I've raced (retired now) for most of my adult life including some pro races, some of my crew have gone onto Champ cars, NASCAR, and F1, I was lucky enough to be associated with a team that won the Champ car title and my engineer was from that team.  This book gives excellent information and if you can read between the lines you will learn quite a bit that can help you in your racing career.  Those who can't learn anything from this book are advanced enough they don't need to buy any books, but most of us don't have last names like Andretti, Senna, Unser, etc.  If any of you have ever read Senna's book on driving you might also say it's nothing special but you need to read between the lines and figure out what he is alluding to, not what he writes directly about.  Few people will directly give you the "secrets" to motorsports

The full novel is filled with action  and historical references, it's worth the money!

This book has a photo of each dessert so you can see what you're making and easy recipes that look impressive, all using a cake mix box of some kind.  Their Snickerdoodle Cake uses a white cake mix, some other ingredients, and includes a Cinnamon Buttercream frosting recipe.  Yum!   I love the variety of recipes (bundts, bars, round, layered, etc.) and my kids and I can do many together.  I think the packaged cake mixes from the store have a nice taste, so these recipes just build on those mixes.  I just want easy recipes that aren't intimidating, and this book is the solution for that.   I highly reccommend The Cake Mix Doctor.

I'm a fan of Bill Myers work and have been since "Blood of Heaven". This one slipped by me somehow and when I saw it I immediately got it. While the plot is somewhat tight for the most part, I do have some problems with parts of it. For one thing, the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him (read the book to find out) shouldn't have any qualms about killing millions of others. So why is he so intent on the stones? But the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old. The minute anything happens, they're all screaming each other's names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it. For the first-time emergency, we can live with it...but when something happens every few chapters, you've got to have a break! "Daniel!" "Tyler!" "Helen!" "Tyler!" "Daniel!" "Dad!" "Helen!" "Tyler!" Give me a break! Otherwise, a good story...though not up to the same level as "Threshold" or "Blood of Heaven" (definitely better than "Eli" though). Recommended

This book gives very good advice about managing behavior problems in difficult children. However, the concept of a "strong-willed child" is confusing because it implies a child with will power or self control. These difficult children actually have poor will power and self control. The techniques given in this book will help teach such children self control.

Joe Pickett's daily life is not as enjoyable as it once was.  His wife now has a successful business and brings home a lot more money than he does, and there's still the temptations both of them thought about while Joe was away at Jackson hanging over their marriage.  His relationship with his fast growing up daughter Sheridan is not what it once was and his new boss is doing everything he can to make Joe's life a misery.  Throw in a civil war between Saddlestring's largest family and the appearance of, after along term behind bars bloodthirsty J. W. Keeley, who will not stop at anything until he has avenged his daughter's (Joe's stepdaughter's) death through the slow and torturous murder of Joe Pickett, and one way or another the era of Saddlestring's game warden is set to end.

Growing one's herbs is satisfying but using them completes the cycle. If you've ever wondered what to do with all the herbs you've managed to put in your garden over the years this book can help you. If you are just starting out with herbs this book can get you going properly. Not only does it have recipes but it has some ideas that I never could have imagined let alone used. The bulk of the book is dedicated to the herbal index which is extremely helpful. Each illustrated herb is broken down and expalined simply as to it's use, from root to leaves. The only problem I found with this section is that it is organized by their botanical names, which unless you're so inclined is difficult to find quickly. This is a minor problem that is remedied by the oversized common name, which of course is not alphabetized but more recognizable. A page is dedicated to over 100 of the most common herbs used. It tells you how to cultivate the individual herb and it's uses, which includes the medicinal use. Even if I don't use all the herbs or have them growing in my garden it is fascinating to know the historical and contemporary use of herbs. This book is a constant learning experience that can be read over and over. A perfect garden companion for that break under a tree. The knowledge can prove to be invaluable. Even such common herbs as Thyme can present posssibly new insights into it's benefits. Have trouble sleeping? The leaves of Thyme can help insomnia as well as stimulate the production of white corpusules to resist infection amongst it's many other attributes. There is much more information than I need here but there is something for everyone, from herbal dyes, to baths and massages and to the ever popular potpourri. This is, as the title suggests, the complete book on herbs. A great book for the kichen or to help you plan your herb garden, this book has as many uses as the author presents uses for the herbs

The Struggle for Revolutionary Culture
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Trotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in life- hunger, sex and death- revolutionary Marxism, which was the driving force behind his life and work, mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger. That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition. However, as Trotsky demonstrates here, Marxist methodology cannot and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle. Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development.

Dr. Alex Delaware is completely incorrigible! I love this character, but no wonder his pal Milo is going gray - keeping Alex out of trouble is a full time job! There is a scene in this one where Milo tells Alex straight out not to go snooping - he tells him, "I know you ..." Yeah, Milo knows him all right, and so do we, don't we? (And if you don't - read the books! They're great!)

John Little and Peter Sisco wrote static contraction... but John takes it a step further and eliminates the need for doing reps with scientific explanations to back up his revolutionary concept of weight training/ muscle building.. My girlfriend and I started doing this method in may of 2005 and I can honestly say i've never found such a fast, quick and easy way to build muscle. This is also a great method for those not wanting to spend hours in a gym... after a while, you only need to workout once a week... but don't forget to stretch afterwards... and don't forget to do cardio on other days.

I admire an author who deviates from a standard formula and the interweaving of two cases really works in "Piece of My Heart." DI Stanley Chadwick faces a murder case in 1969 against the backdrop of a rock 'n roll concert. His teenage daughter has facts to hide and DI Chadwick walks a fine line. DCI Alan Banks is seeking a murderer in 2005 which eventually connects with the 1969 murder.

Ed Hayes exposes himself and one might think that the machine gun style of the book is fantasy but it doesn't do justice to the man himself. His dedication to his clients is legendary and he spends every working moment thinking and working for them. Having shared some of his adventures but as a cop,I found that he loves cops. If it wasn't for the fact that he would not have been able to support his interesting lifestyle he would have been one.

Correcting an oversight ....
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
V. I. Lenin wrote this book in 1917, while he was hiding from the Russian government. Lenin pointed out that "The question of the relation of the state to the social revolution, and of the social revolution to the state, like the question of revolution generally, was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the Second International (1889-1914)". He wanted to correct that oversight, and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book.

I am an experienced Java programmer. This book together with the NetBeans IDE allowed me to come up with a J2ME application in less than a week. The examples in the book is a great resource for learning to write J2ME applications. I learn best when I'm coding. In my case, I used the source from the PeekAndPick RSS Reader to come up with my J2ME text reader. The program has been heavily modified since, but the book provided sample code that was a great starting point for my learning.

Wow! This is a wonderful reference book not only for Taiji Jian (tai chi sword), but also for Taiji Quan. All sections of the book are straight forward and easy to follow. There wasn't any mystical &quot;mumbo jumbo&quot; I couldn't comprehend. The first chapter which gives the reader information about the history of the Taiji jian, I particlularly liked this historical information. Chapter two is for Taiji jian and Tai Chi Quan practitioners. This chapter explains clearly the &quot;ins and outs&quot; of Taiji Quan and Taiji jian. The author explains basic trainning, principles, elements, etc. I found this section of great interest to me having only studied Taiji Quan for about a year now. I believe the information I've gainned from reading this section will help improve my practice.I think advanced practitioners will find chapter two valuable as well. The remaining chapters 3-8 give the reader information on the parts of the jian, how to practce with the jian, basic movements,fighting principles, and a 32 posture form with pictures and detailed explanations. The explaination of each picture includes info about the key points, internal components and the movement itself. This is a great manual that I know I will refer to over and over again. This is a must read book for any Taiji Quan or Taiji jian practitioner

The Hellion Bride is the second book in Bride Series. I love Ryder and Sophie and the joy of meeting other characters from The Sherbrooke Bride. I kept turning the pages to find out their secrets. Deceptive and abusive uncle Theo as well as murder scenes make the story more thrilling and a suspense. The Virgin Bride also comes in handy and she is an angel rather than a ghost for she always is encouraging and very nice. Sinjun pleasantly spices up the whole story. I can't wait any longer to read her own story The Heiress Bride

This book is the best book on Rand's esthetics I've ever read; in fact, it is the only book on the topic that I know of.  It is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical; they are not slavish cultists  savoring every last word written by Rand.  They approach the material with  critical distance and do an excellent job of placing Rand's work in the  larger history of esthetic theory.  They demolish abstract art, and devote  considerable energy to discussing Rand's definition of art.  They even  propose their own individual alternatives!   If anything shows  independence, it is this willingness to debate the differences between the  authors of the same work!  Remarkable!  The world of Rand commentary is  filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship.  That is clear just  by reading one of the reviews here, by people who are devotees of certain  &quot;scholars&quot; who do nothing but repeat the catechism.  They take  swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published; that is why  they hate this book.  Because it is independent-minded.  Judge for  yourself.  Don't be fooled

This book tells girls what good sportsmanship is all about.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
&quot;Good Sports&quot; is a book which helps girls to be the &quot;best athlete you can be.&quot; It catagorizes players, parents, and other important people into real-life situations. It has quizes, quotes from  other athletes, and memory pages. Also, it offers a lot of web sites and  other addresses for girls to look up their favorite sports. More  importantly, this book shows girls what teamwork and good sportsmanship is  all about. One of my favorite parts in the book says: &quot;Sometimes heart  is the strongest muscle.&quot; This book also tells girls how to take good  care of yourself- to eat healthy so that you are a better athlete. It  includes the food pyramid and what one serving is. &quot;Good Sports&quot;  involves &quot;Power Drills&quot; and advice from other girls. It goes  inside the lives of other athletes, such as Michelle Kwan, but also shows  girls'lives who are teens or pre-teens.  This book not only focuses on the  physical parts of playing a game, but on the mental part as well: keeping  your dreams alive even when you're at the bottom of the team, or you were  embarrassed at a basketball game when you tripped. I would reccommend  &quot;Good Sports&quot; to any female athelete, whether you are experienced  or haven't even started yet. It teaches you the basics and also the mental  parts of a game! It has advice on keeping your mind and body strong, along  with being a good winner and loser. It has advice from other athletes,  famous or otherwise, memory pages to record your victories, dreams and  goals, and ways to reach sports associations. As the book says, it includes  &quot;Winning. Losing. And everything in between.&quot

A Reassuring Read

What I like about this book is that the tone is just right for a self-conscious preteen boy who has more questions than answers but is too embarrassed to ask anybody. Leave this book in his room or in the bathroom without making a big deal of it, and I bet he'll take a look inside. Some books are so clinical; others don't provide enough information. This one gets it right--at least for your basic seventh or eighth grader. As someone who has been writing for girls for years, I'm always curious about what is out there for boys, and I like Daldry's style.

HACCP is the acronym for Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points. This text, by Arduser and Brown is the be all and end all on the topic - in my view.  It even comes with a companion CD-ROM that contains all forms from the book in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) and MS Word format. This is a major time saver when it comes to preparing and administering the required tests to staff members and the newly hired.

Haven't tried very many yet, but am looking forward to it -- especially the orange dessert crepes

I studied the medieval Islamic world a little in college, and fell in love. It's a fascinating age in which Central Asian Buddhists, North African nomads, Ethiopian slaves, Greek cave-dwellers, Persian aristocrats, Arab bureaucrats and a host of different cultures came together, mixed, wrote wonderful literature, and lived the kind of drama that makes history fun. But it's hard to find anything written about the time that isn't arcane professor babble or Islam 101. (You know, "There are five pillars of Islam..." Snore.)

Pamela Jaye Smith has an incredible talent for inspiring writers to dig deep into the core of their characters, which invariably leads them to discovering their own personal nuggets of truth.

The book is very well organized and packed with all kinds of valuable treasures.  I highly recommend it

Life in Old Plymouth
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
In this study Demos examines family life as it was for the Pilgrims who came over on the Mayflower, before they joined with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The book is in three main sections: the physical setting (housing, furnishings, and clothing); the structure of the household (family connections, including servants); and individual development (childhood, coming of age, and old age). The most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the Court: although laws were not draconian, they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly. Mess up and you would be punished. But it's also true that people were not that different back then, either: parents still cared for their children and worried about their futures by making provisions for them; families were at the core of society's welfare; even women were given rights denied them in the mother country. It's interesting that even these first settlers saw the American continent as a vast area just waiting to be colonized, and one of the biggest problems facing the authorities was how to keep settlers from wanting to spread out too far from Plymouth itself, thus weakening communal ties. A highly recommended book

It is the perfect thing to read when you're in that  post-breakup stay-in-bed-in-your-pyjamas-and-eat-ice-cream stage.  Beautiful, beautiful work. If all you have to complain about this book is  that you didn't learn how to properly can, you're missing the point. Pay  the extra 5 bucks and spring for the lovely hardcover -- it's worth it. I  cannot say enough wonderful things about this scrumptious, funny, simple  little insightful jewel! Mwah

It's been around two years since I first read this book, and i must say i reference it to people all the time.  the reason: it is so darn fascinating.  i really liked how the author put things in context and made me think about media forms and how we transfer data.  if i gave you an 8-track tape right now, would you know what to do with it to get the info contained on it?  younger folks might not know what it is.  they would recognize tape (maybe), but 100 years from now, how many players would be around?  the book talks about a project the author was on.  a nuclear waste site in new mexico needed to have a way to communicate to humans (or others) in the future that the site is radioactive.  since the radiation could last 10,000 years, the message would have to be able to be understood centuries from now.  what would the message be like?  if you read the book you'll find out!  lots of different ideas are kicked around and i just couldn't put the book down.  buy it, have fun

Things are going swimmingly in Fish! land. In the latest volume, Fish! Tales, authors Stephen C. Lundin, John Christensen, Harry Paul and Philip Strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first Fish book. Tales shows how four companies - a long-distance call center; a hospital neural-renal unit, a car dealership and a roofing company - have applied Fish! theories effectively. They also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the Fish! function. The four main principles are familiar by now - keep the work fun, seek to serve others, stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude - but the examples in the book bring them alive. Along the way, the authors heavily sell their Fish! courses and merchandise - that's just good salesmanship - but the real catch of the day is the final how-to section, showing ways to apply these principles in any organization. The lively writing style helps keep you hooked. We suggest that if you haven't yet caught any Fish!, start with this one. Its cheery, accessible methods should lure you in, hook, line and sinker

I REALLY enjoyed this book.  I thought the movie incorporated most of the good parts in the book.  There were some character changes and some additional characters in the book, but I don't think they hurt the story line by trimming here and there.  I read the book after seeing the movie - I always wondered what the movie had been based on.  I love baseball, and I think the book was great

This novel is more enjoyable than the Flanders Panel, but still not up to the level of the Fencing Master or his recent series, the Captain Alatriste books. The characters are well drawn, the setting comes alive, and the story flows. There are a few sections of the book that need some more editing to make them a bit more crisp, but I cannot tell if that is due to the translation or is in the original. The only real disappointment came when I finished the book:  I wish there was a follow-up

People were looking for a book that could grab them about Nam when this was a best seller in 1972, and this book has details that people were not getting from television or the front page of newspapers in those days.  Magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of Nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in Nam itself as a primary consideration.  Portions of this book originally appeared in `The New Yorker,' so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared.  Frances FitzGerald's original trip to Vietnam was in February to November of 1966, and resulted in articles for the `Atlantic Monthly,' the `Village Voice,' `Vogue,' etc.  People who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like Nam, where large numbers of young Americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion.

Those interested in American art of the last century will find great pleasure in reading this book. Chicago and New York are the centers from which Katharine Kuh radiated. As a museum curator, art dealer, and published critic, she was personally close to many of the modern masters. In this book, she provides short but telling stories about their work and lives. I especially liked the chapters on Rothko, Tobey and Noguchi.

Also caught her live performance at the Los Angeles's Roxy almost 6 years ago just took my breath away. I truly think she's one of the true visionaries of our time

If I were to choose the two best novels by this author, they would be The Nautical Chart and The Queen of the South.  The Fencing Master, by comparison, isn't as lively or as intellectually thrilling -- but it is a chewy read.  I particularly loved the characterization of Don Jaime as an older man realizing what he has lost in his life.

Most people are in awe of the "classic." However, a book does not pick that title on the whim of a professor of arcane texts, rather a book gains such when it constantly and consistently speaks about the human condition. Classics do not only thrill and teach, they also live.

Robert Barid's exploration of history's secret connections is brilliant.

A Solid Defense
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The Gospel of Judas has had its fifteen minutes of fame. It is but another in an endlessly long line of stories or documents meant to shake the foundations of the Christian faith. Like its many predecessors, it gave National Geographic and anti-Christian authors an opportunity to voice their dissension with the biblical story of Jesus. A book titled The Gospel of Judas shot to near the top of the bestsellers lists and nearly as quickly, shot straight back down. Still, while its popularity was short-lived, it allowed Bart Ehrman and other revisionists a chance to laud the epistle for its new insights into the life of Christ. Surely Ehrman forever cast doubt upon his credibility as a historian when he blathered, "(The Gospel of Judas) is one of the greatest historical discoveries of the twentieth century. It rivals the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Gnostic Gospels of Nag Hammadi."

Peter Robinson is one of my favorite authors.  When I travel on vacation I make sure to take his latest novel.   "Piece of my Heart" transitioned between the present and a time about 25 years ago.  The characters were well developed and the story line moved.  There were many layers of sub-plots that were interwoven.  I thoroughly enjoyed how everything was brought to its final conclusion.

This is probably the single best work I've ever seen on the &quot;science&quot; of packing. Joe Back lived and worked in N.W. Wyoming, and was a legend in the area. His humorous annecdotes, and extremely accurate hand drawn diagrams, combined with his obvious knowledge of the subject, make this a &quot;must have&quot; for anyone seriously interested in learning how to pack horses or mules, and survive. This little work deserves a place in any packer's library

A MASTERFUL CONTRIBUTION
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Some previous reviewers have complained about  the complex style and writing of this book. Although in fact it is not an easily readable book, for the general public, if you have a serious interest about the history of the third Reich, make no mistake: you will not be able to overlook this book, which will surely be a  classic. It is a thoroughly well researched  contribution about the connection between religious beliefs and mass fanaticism; the interaction between the "new" domestic and international values, based on aggression; and the other causes involved in the rise (and fall) of the III Reich. From a different perspective from other mainstream historians, this winner of the Samuel Johnson prize for non fiction,  has accomplished quite an original scholarly feat, one which will enlighten the comprehension of this particular  period of history. No wonder many international critics have found the subtitle of this  opus  -A new History- particularly well deserved. Of great interest is the chapter related with the demise of the rule of law, a thorough analysis of the penetration  of the judiciary and the subordination of the police and government to the totalitarian Fuhrerprinzip

As a professional bridal consultant, I keep an extensive library of wedding related books on hand to help my brides design their own weddings.  Ms. McBride's Bridal Flowers is one of my favorites.  It is full of wonderful ideas - not just the traditional "must have" wedding flowers such as bouquets &amp; boutonnieres, but the out-of-the-ordinary (but inspiring) boas, decorated lampposts &amp; gilded calla lilies.  Ms. McBride shows that flowers are for more than just being carried or worn.  The large color photos are fantastic.  So many other books have little or no photos, or hand drawn diagrams that leaves the reader wondering.  Ms. McBride's book lets you see exactly what she is talking about.  It doesn't claim to be a how-to book, but perfect to take along when visiting your floral designer

Really the Last Prophet
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This rare book details Aleister Crowley's ascension as the prophet of a new Aeon, the Aeon of Horus. Out of all the Aleister Crowley books in mass market format, this stood out in memory years after I read it as one of Crowley's most disturbing works. In fact, I questioned my new faith in Crowley's religion Thelema reading this book; this was for real and not a joke. After contemplating, I thought it would be worth it stick with this because witchcraft is now a cool thing amongst today's youth and Crowley was a famous early form of witchcraft as we know it today. This is serious stuff, I wouldn't mess around with this unless you are interested in the occult. It should be noted that real life ritual magick as described in these type of works really do work; I did a ritual from Necronomicon and Lesser Key of Solomon to help with a college Astronomy course- I got a respectable C grade when I close to failing with a D-. But be prepared for some harassment aboyt alleged satanism.

Twain's "before and after" account of his quarter-century on the Old Muddy
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published "Huckleberry Finn," along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.

On the way to a conference in New Orleans, my flight from Raleigh to Charlotte was cancelled due to mechanical problems, and I was booked on a flight to D.C. As I boarded the plane with &quot;The Carolina Way&quot; under my arm, a gentleman seated at the front of the plane asked how I was enjoying the book.  I explained that I had not yet started the book, so I could not give an answer.  The gentleman followed me to my seat and introduced himself as Dr. Gerald Bell, the co-author of &quot;The Carolina Way&quot;.  Myself a Carolina fan, I was pleased to meet Dr. Bell, as he spent several minutes talking about Coach Smith, whom I have admired for over forty years, and the UNC basketball program, which is presently undergoing a much needed resurgence under Coach Roy Williams. Dr. Bell's contributions to the book tie Coach Smith's leadership philosophy to practical business applications by relating wonderful anecdotal references from Carolina's storied history to today's business situations.  Surely, Coach Smith, given his ability to recruit top players, has been criticized by many for his failure to win NCAA championships in the manner of Coach John Wooden at UCLA, but winning two NCAA championships, winning at a consistency high level unmatched by any program without violating strict NCAA rules, and coaching top players that graduated at a +90% rate and have gone on to be successes in their chosen professions underscore the unique successes of Coach Smith's &quot;system&quot;.  Teamwork, integrity, loyalty, and hard work, are the cornerstones of the Carolina Way, and anyone in the position of managing, leading, or molding young people today would benefit from reading this book, corny as it is at times.  This book is not just for Carolina basketball fans

Kellerman At His Best!

This is my favorite Jonathan Kellerman novel. The book focuses on a disturbing story about Munchausen's Disease by Proxy. This book so quickly caught my interest, that I ended up doing my psych 101 paper on this disease. I had not heard of this disorder when I read the book. It was disturbing, intense, and tore away at your heart. I would definitely recommend this book! Munchausen's Disease seems to have become a more popular topic since I read this book. I have seen countless documentaries on, and it was also featured in the newest episode of House. It is a disturbing, yet intriguing disease, and this book delves straight into the ugliest form of it, Munchausen's Disease by Proxy

The story of Illidan, Malfurion, Rhonin, and krasus using dark powers, heroic strength is enough to blow anyone away. Iy enchants me, it shows the World of Warcraft from a combination of Knaak's and Blizzard Entertainment's imagination

The SPARK
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
As an overweight, stressed-out, 40-something professional, I am thrilled to find this book!  The SPARK is exactly what I needed to get my body moving again.  I am one of those who had fallen for the 1-hour a day exercise trap, and if I didn't have an hour, which I usually don't, I just didn't exercise.  I love doing my three to four SPARKS a day, knowing I am doing my body far more good than waiting for that elusive day when I can fit in 45 minutes or more for my workout.  This is a wonderful concept, and so doable! It's working!! Thank you

And the lesson is...

Always think twice. Never jump to hasty conclusions without considering ALL the effects of an act or decision. That's the essence of Economics: "looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy."

Sweet Read
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I found this in the church library, but it is not Christian fiction. It is simply an easy read. The story is sweet, made even sweeter by the topic. Cake. I am not even much of a cake person. I normally prefer ice cream or some sort of brownies/cookies, etc... But, as I read, I found myself longing for a bit of these intoxicating concoctions put together by the narrator. I don't recommend this book if you are diabetic or on a diet. The need for sweets will be simply overpowering

Good info, but missing a certain something...

Overall this book is just fine for someone interested in cooking with a DO. The mix of recipes is fine, but they just seemed to be missing something. They were all more or less of the &quot;huck a good sized hen into the pot and cook for a while until done&quot; variety. All of the recipes look tasty, though I would have liked to have seen a few more meat dishes, especially some more creative ones. Let's be honest, when you pay for a book you'd like to see more than &quot;...put a 5 lb beef roast into a preheated Dutch oven, salt and pepper to taste, cook until done.&quot; Give me a little something to work with here! Inspire me! I can already cook a roast like this in the oven. Having said all of that, I would still reccommend this book. The vegetable dishes and desserts look fantastic and I can't wait to try some of them. As an aside, this is the only Dutch oven book I've seen with heart-healthy recipes as well as more traditional fare. Given that the average DO book requires the use of a metric ton of lard, this will probably appeal to a wider range of cooks

Both of my boys love this book and request it over and over again.   It is such a fun book to read because the children interact with the reader by answering the questions.  Love it!

Best book for teaching children about people and nature.

&quot;The Shaman's Apprentice&quot; presents more information about the relationship between people and nature than many much larger volumes. The story of Kamanya, Gabriela, and the shaman Nahtahlah, educates children about the important roles of all living things. The text is supported by rich and colorful illustrations which easily maintains the interest of children from four to 14. If you want the children in your life to understand the importance of rain forests and the need to preserve them, you must have this book

Fascinating look at America 50 years ago
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
John Gunther's INSIDE U.S.A. comes as close to time travel as we are likely to get, hurling us back to the America of 1947, as he explores, state by state, the people, politics, issues, passions and fads that make up our country.  Written with great energy and insight, Gunther captures an America justly proud of its WWII success, still unsure of its role in the world, and populated by fascinating characters like Mayor LaGuardia of New York, Governor Saltonstall of Massachusetts and Boss Hague of Jersey City.  Gunther describes regional characteristics that persist today.  He captures aspects of America that are gone,l never to return (an &quot;industrial&quot; nation based on coal, iron ore and steel.)  And he foresees issues that dog America to this day -- the &quot;Negro problem&quot; (actually, the &quot;White problem.&quot;)  He condemns the segregationist society he finds in America, so inconsistent with its lofty ideals.  As you can tell, I loved this book.  It's very hefty -- but every time you are about to put it down, Gunther comes up with another amazing fact or interesting sidelight that keeps you reading.  All this said, Gunther does concentrate on the (a) historical, (b) political and (c) economic side of things.  You won't find much here about the arts or science.  But it is amazing a single individual could have compiled this much data and presented it so interestingly

IT'S SHOFAR TIME!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This is the sixth and final addition to the author's excellent Holiday Time series, just in time for Rosh Hashanah! As in the other titles, (It's Challah Time! It's Seder Time! etc.) Tod Cohen's full-color photos capture the joyousness of the children as they learn to celebrate the holiday wearing new clothes, making Jewish New Year's cards for their families, tasting new foods such as pomegranates and star fruits, and blowing the shofar. The sounds of the shofar are explained in easy, understandable terms for this young age level. The children are also shown learning such things as tying their shoes and writing their names.  The brief amount of text on each page and very appealing children pictured learning to make round challot and blow the shofar make this just right for using with pre-schoolers, their parents, and in the classroom. Included is an easy shofar craft and a brief paragraph about Rosh Hashanah. Recommended for all Jewish libraries. Ages: 4-6.  Reviewed by Andrea Davidso

Pretty much all of the Todd Parr books we've read are great but the "Peace Book" and the "Family Book" are by far our favorites.  They are very positive and carry a theme of tolerance.  We'd highly recommend this book!
