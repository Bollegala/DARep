Although this is a nice looking product, and it lives up to the 'good grip' promise, I went back to the company twice for a new one after the metal broke apart at the stress point (the hinge).

My kitchen is entirely Kitchenaid, so I was very excited when Kitchenaid released their silicone bakeware line. I love the color and the way they clean up very nicely. I also love that they do not get scratched or clank around in my cupboards. However, I have noticed that when I bake in these, I can smell the silicone. It even dominates over the smell of the cake or bread that I am making! I have also noticed (especially with this bread pan) that the silicone gives your dessert a slight silicone taste. I own the muffin pans, so I use paper baking cups to prevent this from happening, but with the loaf pan, there is no way around it.

Hardly Commercial Quality
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I am writing this to warn all of you cooks and bakers at home, that like me, prefer real commercial equipment in your kitchen.  Anything less is just a toy.  I had purchased the Waring Pro 1500 convection oven thinking this would be a quality convection oven to replace a Farberware convection oven that I have had for over 10 years and just plain wore out.  I ordered the Waring Pro 1500 from a catalog/online store other than Amazon, I don't know if it is legal to say, but it does have the word Chef's in it.  I was so excited to get it!  I opened the box, set it up, and was so disappointed.  It was made so poorly I was just sick.  The stainless steel top was not smoothed out, the oven door was installed so crooked it scraped the metal off of the side of the controls, and it had been dropped or something before packing because the feet were up inside of the thing, and the top was bent down.  The shipping packaging was fine, there was no broken packing and the box was fine.  OK, so I sent that one back, got a replacement thanks to the wonderful customer service at the online store, and opened the second one, same thing!!  I was so devastated, that I decided to give it a shot anyhow.  While cooking with it, the door had such a bad seal that it just steamed out the front, sides and bottom.  I was amazed that there could be such shoddy workmanship out there on what was being advertised as commercial quality.  OK, so oven number two went back, and I tried one more, what the heck three strikes you are out right?  Right!!  Finally oven number three came and it was put together so much better, seal looked good, top and feet looked good, so I decided to give it a whirl.  Once again, huge disappointment.  The convection fan goes on and off with the burner coils.  Thus not giving the cooking cycle a true convection.  I called Waring customer service and it was confirmed by engineering that they designed the fan to come on and off with the coils.  Bad design!  It took longer to bake cookies in there than it would my regular oven, and then they were hard and dry.  I rotisseried a chicken and it took over 1 and a half hours and when I cut it, the skin was soggy, not crisp, and it wasn't cooked all the way through after 90 minutes!  The thing popped (sounded like it was going to blow up) every time it heated up because they riveted the rack holders in there so tight, also making it nearly impossible to go from racks to using baking trays.  OK, that was it!!  After extensive internet research, I finally found a convection oven that is truly a commercial oven made for residential use, and exchanged it with the wonderful catalog/online store mentioned before and got the Cadco Commercial (and I do mean Commercial) half size convection oven Model number OV-350 and have used it many times since it's arrival and absolutely love it!!  I know it is twice the price, but as usual, you get what you pay for.  There is a smaller size version of the Cadco/Broilking oven that is quarter size, for people that do not need to bake huge quantities like me, that is the same price as the Waring Pro.  Please people, if you are at all a person that demands quality in your kitchen, do not waste your time on the Waring Pro, just skip right to the real commercial stuff and save yourself some major stress!!  Thanks again to the wonderful customer service at the aforementioned catalong/online company for NOT making me be stuck with the worthless Waring PRO 1500!!  Go for the Cadco!

We never even plugged this sucker in.  I wanted a countertop convection oven that would accomodate a pizza or 9 x 13 pan, and this unit was supposed to do that.  What none of the product decscriptions mentioned is that this "countertop" unit should NOT be used underneath a cupboard.  Don't most kitchen countertops have a cupboard over them?  Also not mentioned is that the unit required a 4" clearance on the sides: so whatever the dimensions of the unit are, you need to add 8".  I'm sending this monster back and getting something smaller

Unfortunately, if you have an older gas oven like we do, the temperature of your oven may actually be higher than the temperature at which you set it on the dial. This led to problems determining a safe temperature in which to use the trays. We were all hesitant to eat the muffins I'd made because of the chemical/plastic smell. I'm back to using foil muffin cups on a cookie sheet

The FS150 food slicer is fine for very light duty work such as cheese or lunch meats providing you don't push this unit too hard or use it too frequently. Ours lasted a year and a half of very occasional use before it burned out. The two biggest drawbacks are the sliding rail and the motor/gear train. First the slider is simply a  cheap plastic bushing on a metal rod that tends to bind up fairly quickly. We found that a little olive oil wiped on to the rod kept things moving well enough but it needs to be treated every time you use the slicer and then cleaned afterwards. Food grade Teflon or silicone spray did not seem to work as well as the olive oil.

I was actually satisfied with this slicer until I needed to clean it.  When you remove the blade, there is a plastic ring or seal that clings to a metal rim with brittle, plastic "fingers".  An intelligent engineer would have seated this ring in a channel rather than have it mounted by flimsy, brittle fingers to a thin semi-circle of metal.

Impossible to clean!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This thing slices well, then comes the impractical task of trying to clean it. The tray does not detatch from the base, which cannot be put in water because it containes the motor. Pieces of food work their way into the motor area. After removing the blade (using tools) you must remove a plastic cover with 3 screws and dig out the pieces of food. I could not believe how bad a design it was from a cleaning standpoint. The tray that slides back and forth with the food has a stainless top that is literally two-faced taped onto the plastic base. This was very poor from a quality standpoint, and came off in my hand the first and only time used. The plastic base for this tray has about fifty little half inch square honey-comb sort of areas that grease from meat or juices from food WILL get down into. This thing is a nightmare to adequately clean and not worth the trouble. It went back to the store immediately, and it was not all the way clean because after about thirty minutes I gave up. I'm looking for another brand now

I bought this product because the box says "no more ice chunks." There is even an "icebreaker" setting.  I wanted a way to make slushies.  However, the manual says you are to use the "icy drink" setting when crushing ice.  I am not sure if or when a person is supposed to use the "icebreaker" setting!

Too heavy on handle end
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
These tools are made of high quality materials, and they look very nice. However, the ends of the handles are so thick and heavy that if you leave them propped on the side of a shallow pot or pan, or on the counter, they are very prone to flip out of the container or off of the counter, carrying food with them to the kitchen floor. This happened to me twice while cooking thanksgiving dinner. I will not throw them away, but I would never buy them again.

Would look great if it lined up correctly.  Goes together very crooked & doesn't line up 100% with other parts, & there are only three major parts.  I ordered two holders, & both have the same problems.  May redrill the screw holes to line things up better, but may just return both for a refund.

After getting the teakettle in January, I had to stop using it by June.  The kettle was leaking water all over the kitchen counter and at time it would not turn off by itself.  Delongi sent me a new kettle to replace the one that was broke  but it was a model only worth $80.00.  When I ask about the $50.00 difference in price of the two teakettles I was told they covered their warranty and I'm out of the $50.00. I won't be buying anymore of Delongi products!

Like the other reviewers, I followed the instructions for this machine to the letter.  I froze the canister in my deep-freeze for several days and took it out just in time to load it.  Although the recipe provided was quite tasty, even after 60 minutes the stuff never even got cold enough to reach the slush stage, let alone ice cream.  My kids pretty much drank it from the bowl.  It's advertised to make ice cream in 20 minutes; no way.  Returned it the next day (and paid for shipping)

looks great but poorly designed
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Let me begin with a positive note on the OXO Good Grips oven mitt:  It looks great and the magnet is a good idea. Now for the negative aspects of this item:  it's WAY over-priced, especially for how poorly it is designed. The way this oven mitt is designed does not give you a "Good Grip," which is ironic since it's called the "OXO Good Grips" oven mitt.  It's hard to explain, but the silicone part is somewhat stiff and when you put your hand in the mitt, you cannot easily grab things, especially if what you're trying to grab is small (like a pan lid) or narrow (like the handles on a roaster pan).  It's like this mitt was designed as though the only thing anyone uses an oven mitt for is to take hot cookie sheets out of the oven. I decided not to give it one star ONLY because it does a good job of insulating your hand from high temperatures.  I strongly suggest that if you are considering purchasing this OXO mitt, you should go to a store and try it on first to see what you think about the design.

I bought this pan as a Christmas gift for my husband.  It would have been easier if I had just put a match to my money and burned it.  He has given up using this pan.  He even read the directions thinking he was doing something wrong.  Every egg he placed in it stuck to the side of the teflon rings.  What a shame.  The only use would be to throw the rings away and just use it as a regular pan.  Don't waste your money

Assembling and disassembling this piece of equipment would discourage a person from ever using this item.  It is far too complicated and has too many pieces that have to be washed each time it is used and then put back together again.  One can expect to spend about 30 minutes to disassemble and reassemble the unit while following the assembly guide. In addition to that drawback, there isn't anything that should be placed in a dishwasher, so it has to be hand-washed and hand dried. An osterizer would be a much simpler and better choice!!!

Disappointing Poacher
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I purchased this egg cooker specifically for poaching 2 eggs. I used large, farm-fresh eggs. Whatever combination of water and timing I tried, I never got a perfectly cooked poached egg. The Cuisinart instruction book is confusing in its layout - specifically page 5. I called Cuisinart and after much back and forth, it was determined the eggs I used were too large and the directions were for MEDIUM-sized eggs. If considering this machine, be aware you might have to sacrifice the eggs you want to eat.

This stunning slice of kitchen couture is undoubtedly a tactile and aesthetic dream - built with quality materials like real metal (not silvery plastic), and sporting a sophisticated, drop-dead gorgeous retro appeal.  It looks equally as impressive in the hippest New York loft kitchens as it does on the shelves of Williams-Sonoma.

"Warring" has a high reputation for being a powerful blender. I purchased because of its reputation. But it turned out to be actually not that powerful and may not be as powerful as the one I had before which only costed $30. So I asked myself why bothered to replace it when the new one, "Warring", in fact does not really break ice any better than the cheap ones.

We lived in Asia for five years and we eat a lot of rice.  In Asia we owned a very cheap rice cooker that worked perfectly well (but different voltage).  When we returned to the USA, I purchased the cuisinart 8-cup rice cooker (CRC-800) thinking I was getting "top of the line."  It made such an enormous mess every time we used it, so I called cuisnart to find out if somehow (despite meticulous reading of the instructions) we were doing something wrong.  No, it seemed we were doing everything correctly.  So we tried a few more times, and then in exasperation returned the rice cooker for a new one.  We thought given the generally good quality of cuisinart appliances, this one must be defective.

Do not waste your time in purchasing this product.  At first, I thought this would be a great kitchen gadget for making small cones for my kids or when I just want a little treat, but I was wrong.  The manufacture didn't think that as soon as the waffles are done, you have to be quick and roll the waffles into cones for it too cool.  Well, instead of making one, you have to roll three in enough time before it cools.  I tried numerous times to roll each one quickly as possible, but by the second one the third waffle is cooled and has not had the chance to be rolled up into a cone.  It really is not smart for the manufacture to sell this product, unless it comes with three cone makers to wrap the waffle in.  And, to state that you need three people to make it or it will not work.  Do not bother purchasing this product, unless you are an expert cone maker.  I did, however, went ahead and purchased the regular sized cone maker.  It is hard to perfect the perfect cone without having a hole at the bottom, but at least I have time to wrap up one cone at a time without having it cool on me to quickly.  Also, the petite cone waffle maker is rediculously too small to try to wrap.  It really is a waste of energy.  You could put batter in only one of the cone indentions, and do it one by one if its what you are looking for.  That could work.  All in all, personally it wasn't worth my time and money spent on the thing

Cuisinart does not stand behind their products. We purchased a 10 pc set and after using the 1   qt pan only once it formed a bubble on the bottom of the pan causing the pan not to lay flat on the stove. This actually renders the pan useless as it does not evenly disperse the heat and takes forever to even heat up.

I researched a lot before buying this slow cooker. I have a Nesco roaster that I love and use often. I needed a large slow cooker. I started researching. Started out with the all clad but everyone said it got really hot. I wanted a good one. The Cuisinart had good ratings elsewhere and I thought well even it cooks faster that is fine. I will just watch it until I get used to it and go from there. Every dish I have watched..they all cooked in LESS than half the allotted time. Today I made a crock pot mac and cheese casserole and it burned within ONE HOUR. Way too hot. I called Cuisinart several times and they said I may have a defective unit. Well I doubt it. I just think it runs hot. I really was dismayed because I love the size and the design of this cooker. Really was not up to par with Cuisinart products that I know and love.

I own many Circulon products, but most of which are under the Circulon 2 line. So when this 2 pack became available, I went ahead and purchased it. I have only used it to cook eggs on and I must say, I was sorely disappointed by the results. Not only did my eggs stick, but I used quite a bit of oil on the 2nd batch to make sure they wouldn't stick, but they still stuck. My Circulon 2 skillet makes far better eggs than this non-stick version and doesn't stick!

Looks great, but as a toaster much to be desired.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I should have simply repaired our old toaster that worked well, and reliably, for eight years.  Too busy, first I bought a Braun toaster (looked great, had major problems actually toasting), then I bought this Krup toaster, and guess what, it looks great but has trouble actually toasting.  Starting with the first piece of toast all is well (hence two stars instead of one).  However, after the toaster is warmed up, the timing/heat regulation becomes totally useless.  You have to toast, toast again, toast again.  Fancy digital count-down-timer doesn't help much at that point!  In researching toasters, did I mention I should have repaired my old toaster when it broke, I read a review where it was suggested that 'toasters have been around a hundred years, it can't be that hard!'  I thought it funny at the time, but having now spent over $150 on two worthless toasters I find myself saying "toasters have been around for over a 100 years, it can't be that hard!"  I hope Braun and/or Krup don't make medical devices or we are in trouble.

Bought this and hate  it!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Just purchased this blender & am returning it immediately. It has a number of terrible  features: it's very difficult to remove the cover if you have carpal tunnel, arthritis, or weak hands. To change speeds you turn a dial (as opposed to the buttons on most others), which makes for rough transitions. Moreover, the dial feels very flimsy and I doubt this machine will last. I purchased this model because I thought its premium price would mean a premium product, but from the plastic gears to the flimsy dial, to the impossible-to-open cover, I hate it. Will go back to either an Oster or Waring, both of which served me well, each for over 10 years.

Not the same as the Cast Aluminum Rose Bundt
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I wish I had read the review by Mary Twain before purchasing the Pro Form Rose Bundt.  Because it was made by Nordic Ware, I thought it would be the same as the cast aluminum but it's not.  Don't be fooled b/c the cake will not look like a rose.  The pan is more shallow & the ring is bigger than the cast aluminum.  Since I only paid $9.99 for this, I didn't want to waste paying for shipping to get a refund

Thankyou for the reviews about quality.  I wanted to share with krups why I wouldn't buy there panini maker.  But when I tried to email customer service it was to complicated to let them know.  I also read there warranty and it appears your grills should be covered under one year.  But of course it adds at there discretion.  I am still deciding which to get but cuisinart has a 3 year warranty

Not a good foam pump.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The soap shoots straight out of the pump and can go about three feet.  (Children would love this feature.)  You have to hold your hand awkwardly in front of the spout to keep the soap in your hand or pick up the pump and pump it directly into your palm.  Also the pump sticks and has to be pulled up manually.  You cannot use this pump with one hand - not good for kitchen use

I had one a few months ago.  When I filled in water, the water just passed the filter quickly. I was not sure if the water is filtered.  One day, I wanted to clean it.  I put it in hot water for about 10 minutes.  The pitcher was out of shape and I had to discard it.  I believe the pitcher was made from cheap materials.  I sent  an email to the custom no service of Brita.  I got no response.  I will not buy Brita products any longer

I purchased this knife, and when it arrived, the package said, "Not recommended for left-handers."  If Henckels chooses to design only for right-handed people, that's their right, but they should disclose it clearly.  Second, [Amazon.com] should include such information in their editorial review.  I'm left-handed, and I'll add this to my can opener and vegetable peeler as one-way kitchen gadgets

Unsuitable for Brown Rice
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I spent several hours searching &amp; researching rice cookers trying to find one that was designed specifically for brown rice. I finally decided on this one because it specifically mentioned brown rice, and had brown rice &quot;measurements&quot; which are different than for regular white rice. I am disappointed. First of all, the manual recommends NOT using the &quot;keep warm&quot; function when using brown rice. This means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over. This defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker. But even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly. It does not. It is either too wet &amp; mushy, or too dry and burnt. We have been unable to cook a proper batch yet, after much experimentation with slightly more or less water, and using 3 different types of brown rice. Look elsewhere, and let me know if you find one that works properly with brown rice

Worked great until it died - Black & Decker Customer Service terrible!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I loved this iron until it died after owning it for a little over a year.  I bought this iron because Consumer Reports rated it #1. It was a great iron while it worked.  (I iron about once a week - sometimes twice a month.)  I've had irons last for years and I usually get rid of them because they lack the bells and whistles not because they fail to work. Black & Decker Customer Service acted like I was the only one whoever had a problem with one of their products and told me to go buy another iron because it was over a year old.  I'm sorry, but I think with light use, an iron should last more than a year.  Forget Black & Decker. I'm trying Rowenta or Bosch

Base appears to work  - but remote is a joke
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
This is a cheap piece of junk.  The base won't communicate with the remote even after extensive review of directions and trying different channel selections as directed.  The plastic housings are so lightweight I don't think it'd survive ordinary outdoor use either.  Certianly not a drop off your grill.  Felt like I had to handle it gingerly so I didn't crush it with my hands.  This one is going back -Sorry AZ.

Great device - Until the probe fails
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
If the probe was not so fragile I'd give this unit 5 stars. The remote works well although I have had it lose contact with the sender if I was out in front of my house (my grill is on the back deck). This is a minor annoyance, but what really ticked me off was that the probe failed (indicating "HIGH" reading) in conditions where my MIU France unit keeps on going. Unfortunately the MIU France unit doesn't have the remote capability. I purchased about 5 extra probes for the Taylor unit directly from Taylor by mail. But within a few weeks several of those failed. I don't mind having to replace a probe once in a while but when you have to replace two in one cooking session it gets pretty annoying. I'd suggest staying away from this unit

I LOVE to grill but I keep my grill a fair distance from my house while cooking so you can imagine the excitment I had in purchasing this item with the wireless transmitter.  First, it took more than 1/2 an hour to get the two pieces to communicate with each other.  Secondly, and worst of all, on just my second attempt using it I was watching my pork roast temperature from the comfort of my kitchen when the temperature value jumped to "HIGH".  I immediately went out to check it and the probe is DEAD!!!  There's no way to purchase a replacement probe so the whole thing is just a fancy kitchen timer!!  Taylor is NO HELP!

This product is a disgrace. Nonstick is not one of its virtues, and those who are thinking of purchasing this waste of money should be forewarned.

Mediocre for a Krups appliance
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
It looks like a Krups -- what with the stainless steel look and the fancy electronics, but, as a rice cooker, it does not  perform as expected.  The rice is passable but certainly not the best we've had - our very old National rice cooker produced better rice.  Also disappointing is the lack of a retractable electrical cord - winding the electrical cord around a chintzy metal cord holder (unstrategically located at the bottom of the cooker) gets old very quickly.  Lastly, the fancy electronic display is not very informative when cooking rice.  (It may be more helpful when using the appliance as a slow cooker - but we thought we were buying a rice cooker.)

All the airbake products I have used thus far have proven awful over time. After only several uses, cookies stick (even after religious greasing of the sheet) and the sheets are impossible to clean without scratching or rubbing off the surface. Now I have to place a silpat on top to save myself the headache. I'd save my money and spend it on a heavier duty, higher quality baking sheet.

AirBake products are horrible! I have used the cookie sheets multiple times and I have had nothing but problems. There products over-brown everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans. I have better luck using my old cheap non-stick bakeware than AirBake. Buyer beware! If you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature

I read all of the reviews and thought this was the paper towel holder for me. Boy, was I wrong. It looked beautiful when it arrived and I couldn't wait to use it. Well, I put on my first roll of paper towels and pulled one off. The racheting system worked ok until it came towards the end of the roll. The racheting stopped and jammed and the paper towels ripped in half instead of where they were supposed to. I am going back to the old paper towel holders that just have a stick holding the roll and not a racheting whisk like bar. Jesh, all I want is a paper towel not aggravation. Which is what I got with this item

I bought the VillaWare Double Smoothee maker and it was a problem from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  First, the silver lable was not glued on the product and wouldn't stick.  Next when I made the product using THEIR receipe it wouldn't dispense from the spout and the spout connecting to the blender leaked.  Tried calling the seller and emailing them about my problem and they wouldn't help.  I called the manufacture and since I bought it HERE from a vendor they would help.  So...now...its in the blender heaven of trash somewhere out there.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.  THANK GOD FOR AMAZON'S ABC GUARANTEE!!

My husband bought this machine because it was supposed to be fast and convenient, and with different schedules, easier to brew one cup at a time. It worked fine at first, but now after just 3 weeks it leaks hot water all over the counter. This has happened to both my husband and me so it's not bad technique on our parts. We follow directions exactly, but we keep having to stop it, open the lid, check the pods, reclose the lid and try again. This takes all the convenience out of it especially when you have to clean coffe puddles off your counter. This just isn't acceptable, but it's mostly plastic so probably to be expected. We have used other pods besides the Senseo pods (which don't produce good coffee) but that shouldn't be an issue as they're all the same size. Anyway, we're trashing it and have ordered the Bunn professional which will hopefully do a much better job. I'll let you know in a future review. My advice on this one is either don't buy it or if you do, based on other positive reviews, keep the box and the receipt so you can return it when it starts malfunctioning

Not up to Calphalon standards
</Text>

<text>
<Text>
I purchased these pans based on my previous positive experiences with Calphalon cookware--have tons of it, but I experienced the same problem as two other reviewers--that is, the slumping in the middle.  I have been cooking for over 30 years and have never experienced this problem, especially since I have a new Kitchen-Aid convection oven.  Also, the &quot;non-stick&quot; is not so &quot;non-stick&quot;.   At their prices, I think they have a little work to do to meet other Calphalon products

I have been grinding my own coffee beans every morning for many years and have gone through quite a few different grinders.  I have always loved  Cuisinart products and was very excited to purchase this one, what a mistake!  The grinder itself is really noisy and heavy for it's size. The coffee grinds are never fine enough for my liking and they get stuck up inside the plastic top, making a huge mess and wasting a lot of coffee.

Grounds for Disappointment
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I was excited to upgrade to this coffee grinder after years of using a cheap Krups model, and I have to say that I am very disappointed with the way this machine grinds coffee. It takes way too long to grind, whether pulsing or grinding continuously. And then the grounds are very uneven. Although the manufacturer says it is grinding slowly to keep the flavor in, every coffee expert I've consulted with says the longer coffee grinds, the more it heats up and the more flavor is lost. Even after long grinding, there are large pieces of bean still visible. I was also excited about the machine's detachable bowl, which does make for easy cleaning. But only of the bowl. The rest of the machine is a pain to clean and no matter how carefully you remove the top, your counter is covered in grounds. I bought a second bowl so that I could grind spices in the same machine, and I think the coffee grinder works better on spices and seeds (such as flax) than it does on coffee. But you still have to clean the entire thing before reusing it, or your spices have a strong coffee flavor from the grounds that are stuck to the protective case. (That plastic case does make grinding quieter, however.) All in all I'm quite disappointed with this purchase. I should have gone farther upscale and gotten a more serious burn grinder, or stuck with my cheap Krups with the slanted bowl base which made even grounds quickly.

50% of the bags leak.  The plastic is thin and rips easily.  Don't even think about using these for uder the bed storage.  The bags will get tears on them if you just breate on them heavy.

This product was horrible. I ordered a queen size and expected a huge box to arrive carrying such.  However, it was so small that a pair of shoes could have fit in it.  When I took the featherbed out of the box, it was terribly thin.  I currently have a featherbed and it is nice and fluffy.  This item unfortunately felt as though I was simply lying on a blanket.

The only thing I do not like of this pitcher is its lid. The lid is not quite sealed so that the water could leak from the back and wet your sleeve. Even worse, sometimes the lid fell off. You have to be careful while using it. Not recommend

West Bend Triple Timer
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I used a West Bend Triple timer for about 25 years and was well satisfied with it. It had a loud alarm. The new model has a clock (not very useful), a stop watch function (moderately useful) and a triple timer function (fairly useful). Unfortunately the timer functions are more difficult to set than on the older unit. The alarm is very weak, very difficult for me to hear. I am looking for another alarm.

Never Again For This Skillet
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
If I could give no stars for this, I would. I've been using electric skillets for more years then I care to say. I love cooking with them and when my last one simply wore out from so much use, I bought this one. What a mistake. After only minimal use, the middle of the pan began to burn extra hot and all the food was sticking and burning. Then the coating began to peel from the pan. The middle began to buldge slightly so the surface was not flat for even frying. What a nightmare!! This pan was less then two months old! And I do know how to treat and cook with electric skillets - just in case you were thinking I did something to cause this. I have never been so disappointed in a product before. However, it did have a new place in our home - the trash can. Guess I should have read the reviews first. Now that was my mistake!!

How can a coffee maker be this bad?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
When I received this coffee maker, it worked long enough for me to run water through it to clean it out, then then heating element stopped working.  It took numerous calls to Braun, then of course I had to pack it up and ship it off.  Several weeks later it was returned to me and once again, it worked one time.  Again, it took several phone calls and I had to pack it up and send it off again.  I received a new unit that does indeed heat up, but has several other problems.  The drip shut-off mechanism stopped working after a couple weeks, the permanent filter allows grounds to get into the coffee, and if one uses a paper filter, it tends to overflow the filter basket.  This is the worst coffee maker I've ever owned

We have a full line of Fiesta dishware and thought having the matching flatware would be nice. After a year of standard use and dishwashing, about 1/3 of the flatware is unusable. The upside is that it is cheap and replaceable. But count me among those who would rather pay more for something that lasts. We are in the process of ditching the Fiesta flatware line and moving to something more robust.

Where the X#@%&^* is the gasket?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Look, the product plainly reads "Oster Blender Blade with Gasket" and the package that was delivered is titled "Processing Unit with Sealing Ring".  The blade was in the package but there was no sealing ring/gasket to be found.  I'm sure there is the possibility that I got the one defective package off the line but what kind of quality assurance is that?!  I'm not telling anyone to buy or not buy this product but just be aware that you may have a problem.  I now need to buy a whole separate gasket which maybe costs all of $1.50 and will pay shipping of probably $3.

Not very useful - stainless mesh strainers are better.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This gadget is better than nothing as a sink strainer ( unlike the  miserable Sinktastic, which I find hopelessly misdesigned) but it's still far inferior to any good stainless steel mesh strainer. (Do a web search for "sink mesh strainer".) This one slides around on top of the sink drain, letting gunk slide in around it. Yet it's impossible to pick up without using your (ewww) fingernails. And those fingernails will be picking up a rusting metal edge, if yours grows old at all like mine did.

I totally agree with the previous reviewer.  This pan is terrible.  I also ended up with only tops.  I suppose you could put paper muffin cups in, but what would be the point of buying this pan then???  Also, these do not nest like a regular metal pan (the sled takes up a lot of room).  DO NOT BUY THIS

Beautiful Heirloom Bloom Dinnerware

<text>

I am very pleased with the dishes.  Years ago I owned Corelle dishes, and am now wondering why I went the way of the heavier dishes.  They don't scratch or take up a lot of space.  I bought two sets.  I love love the colors and my table settings are so nice to look at, especially since I purchased table mats with big orange blooms to put the dishes on and celery napkins to match. It really makes for a beautiful table. I get compliments all the time.  I was also very pleased with how quickly I received the dishes  - in about 3 days.  I am always happy with my purchases made through Amzon.com

I expected the dishes to be more substantial. The plates are very light and thin, more like melamine in feel. The colors on the dinner plates and bowls are like in the pictures seen on the internet so they are what I expected. Very disappointed with the cups- I bought two sets, and only 1 of the 8 cups had ALMOST the same color intensity as the dinner plates-the others were so faded (kinda like when your color cartridge in your computer is outta ink) they looked like, either rejects,or they had gone through a heavy load dishwash 100 time

Design Flaw in OXO Knives
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
My Son, who is a Culinary graduate, purchased a set of OXO knives for me as a gift.  I know they were not inexpensive.   However, within a year, three of the six knives seperated from the grips during use.   While the grips are quite nice, the knives are dangerous to use and can cause serious injury in the kitchen.   They should be removed from the market.   In all three cases, the blades flipped upwards during slicing.

<Text>
Sorry to disagree with other reviewers, but my experience of the paring knife was that it's perhaps the softest metal I've ever seen used in a knife, and as a result, it's not very sharp and doesn't improve if you try sharpening it. My friend, a fellow cook who got it as a gift, doesn't like it; I hated it and would never choose to use it. There's a reason the price is so low

This grinder worked well for about two months before the internal spring that holds the nutmeg in place became loose. Now there is so little pressure against the nutmeg, that the blade can no longer do any grinding. In addition, the size and shape of the entire mill are awkward for my small hands.

Not happy with this toaster - many problems
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Received this toaster as a Christmas present in 2004.  From day one I was not very happy with it.  The knobs and temperature control are difficult to use - sometimes it would bake good, other times it would not.  About 6 months ago I noticed the numbers were rubbed off of the timer dial.  About 3 months ago the timer dial became loose and it was difficult to set the time.  Today the timer dial broke off completely.  So I got about a year and a half of poor use out of it.  So, don't purchase this product, it is not worth it.

Unfortunately, I ordered these twice and received rectangular bakers instead.  This was *not* Amazon's fault, but Emile Henry's for mislabling the box as oval bakers when they were not.  In fairness to Amazon, they tried to make it right but had a difficult time doing so since the contents of the box were mislabled.

I recently got this set and the 2 piece carving set of the same series. I know I should not have expected much for this great price, but the knives do not have anywhere as good a feel as the classic line of wusthof or the henckels 4 or 5 star knives. They are very light in weight, mostly due to the handles. Much better than a target or kmart knife, and great to start, but I expect to switch mine out with 'real' knives as my budget will allow

I baked two batches of madelines side by side, one in this pan (set on a baking sheet), and another in a traditional pan with non-stick coating. I brushed both pans with canola oil before using. As per the package instructions, I allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them. The madelines in the traditional pan released easily, were golden and high, and had a pronounced design. The other batch were almost soggy (probably from cooling in the pan), flat, pale, and did not have the appearance of a madeline. To make matters worse, they did not release easily, and a few of them even broke as I attempted to remove them. I would not recommend this pan

Although this grill has all the design elements I wanted - easy to use, quick to clean, and very compact, it is very cheaply made.  After just 3 uses, One of the joints that adheres the top to the bottom broke.  Had I not reacted quickly, I would have been burned.  We were very fortunate that our child was kept away from ever using it.

I honestly liked the blender a lot.

At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid's brand and durability behind it.

Hot grinds and hot coffee spewin' action!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Well, I can't say that I didn't like this thing at first.  It came with a little scoopy to dig out your coffee beans and grinds.  At first it seems like a nice little unit.  I poured a pot of water into it in order to do away with any oils left over from manufacturing.  I say you should run 3 pots of water through it before use (filterless of course).  After a few uses, I noticed that the carafe does spill out onto the counter if you do not pour slowly.  If you want your coffee now and have no time to pour, don't get this item.  After having this machine for 3 weeks now, and using it constantly every morning, I have finally decided that it is near total crap.  I just made a pot of coffee this morning when the machine decided it would spurt some hot air &amp; water which caused the grinds blow all over the place.  Spilling out of the top onto the carafe and drooling hot coffee and grinds all over the counter.  How nice.  If you're going to buy a cheap coffee maker, spend the extra 5 or 6 dollars and get a semi-decent one.  Toastmaster should stick to toasting.  If you do decided to get this, buy some towels and a mop as well

For fifteen years I've talked about getting a good stand mixer and my sweet husband went out and bought me this one. He bought it on sale at Cosco last Spring, then stored it until we moved back to the States from Europe and gave it to me as a housewarming gift in Nov.  I've used it a few times but the paddle and whisk don't reach the bottom of the bowl and the screw meant for adjustment will NOT tighten any further.  I can't get into the bowl at all while it is in the upward position... to scape or to add ingredients. I like to make crepes, which calls for adding sifted flour gradually over eggs while beating. It's impossible with this machine. I get a gluey mass at the bottom of the bowl, unmixed... and the batter is full of lumps.  If I want to scape the bowl, (which is frequently necessary since the paddle or whisk doesn't reach all the way to the sides of the bowl) I have to stop the machine and lower the bowl each time, and even then, with the paddle or whisk attached, it's not easy to reach the sides of the bowl towards the back. You can't turn the bowl without removing it from the stand completely. You have to yank on the bowl and lift at the same time to remove it from the stand. This takes a fair amount of force to maneuver. It's impossible to remove the paddle or whisk without first letting it drop completely into the batter. The speeds are not variable enough. It seems to be either ploddingly slow or so fast that any liquid or flour flies out.

Rating should be "0" but that wasn't a choice.  I ordered this item at beginning of July pending move to a place that didn't have a dishwasher.  They backordered it until August 10.  So I waited and didn't have sanitized dishes in the meantime for myself and my 12 pets.  Then, on August 9, they sent me an email saying "we can't get this item, we're cancelling the order."  I have gone 5 weeks without a dishwasher!  Now I have to go find another online store to order from.  Target may advertise the cheapest price but THEY DON'T DELIVER

Junk!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This thing is a piece of junk! It's the only blender I've ever seen that comes with a "stir stick" to unclog the sides of the jar (where the stuff all goes instead of into the blades). This should have been a clue that the thing wasn't very well designed, and it wasn't. It ALWAYS needed to be stirred when making any kind of smoothie, several times, which made the process a real pain. Also, the drain spout is a great place for food to hide and get nasty. Except for the jar it's pretty cheap plastic. But it's in the trash now because the couleing fried itself after two months. Good riddance

The "brushed chrome" is plastic. The spout leaks, and the motor burned out in one week. On top of that the store where I purchased it, Kitchen Kapers wouldn't let me return it saying it wasn't designed for drinks that require crushing ice. Why then do some of the recipes in the manual call for ice cubes?

I had received this set for my Birthday from a friend.  When we unpacked the set we noticed the 8 Quart pot was scratched on the interior.  This made the non-stick aspect of the pot worthless.  I gave the pots back to my friend and he returned them to Amazon and had a new set sent out.  When we received the new set the 8 quart pot again had scratches inside the pot.  I thought I would contact Calphalon to inquire about the damage and see what they had to say.  I called the Calphalon customer service number but was on hold for so long I gave up.  In retrospect I would spend the extra money and stay away from the non-stick surfaces with teflon coating which are prone to scratch easily.  If you get the Calphalon One Infused-Anodized pans which you will never have to replace let alone deal with the lack of customer service.  Remember the old saying "you get what you pay for."  I don't think these non-stick pans will look very good after a years worth of use.  If you do choose to buy these pans examine them when you open the box for damage

Coffee Tastes Bitter

We had a Krups for about 4 years at the office and the coffee was good. We needed to replace it because the Carafe broke and there was no replacement available (they discontinued the model and the carafe - thanks Krups). So, we replaced it with the FM4. I didn't like the coffee from the start - but I figured it would get better. Two weeks later, I dumped it for a Bunn B10-B which got good ratings here. Get the Bunn - it makes a good cup of coffee.

You have the bottom of the pan clad in stainless steel...the advantage of that? You can dishwasher stainless. But you can't dishwasher nonstick! You just have the disadvantage of slower heating than you would with straight aluminum underneath.

I bought this with a lot of expectations hoping to cook indoor healthy grilled meats during winter. As soon as I saw the pan I was a little disappointed with the ridges. They are deep (which is good) but very thin and not thick as it appears in the product photos. So your meats will be less brown.

hard to turn
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I realize I'm in the minority here, but I do not find this can opener comfortable to use.  The crank does have a "good grip", but I'm not trying to grip it, I'm trying to turn it.   I do this by putting my right thumb under the near end and pushing up, with my index finger on the far end pushing down.  The knob's shape (relatively short, fat in the middle and tapering to rounded ends) makes this cumbersome and tiring.  It does open cans cleanly most of the time, but If i'm opening a large can or several cans, I reach for my old basic Swingaway (which sells, incidentally, for less than half the price of this OXO)

I received this saute pan for Xmas.  I have other Caphalon (no-stick) pans and was delighted, based on claimed attributes of their top-of-line pan.  However, my pan did not have a flat bottom which is a problem on an electric range. I returned to Caphalon and hav'nt heard a thing. I tired to claim lost but ups has proof of delivery - I would like to get a known reliable brand. I dislike poor products, am extremly disappointed with the service and total inconvience of the warranty program.

I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed.  It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble.  The opening is way too big to accomplish that so, back it went to the supermarket.  I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't, I am rating this only one star.

I am a man who loves his tea.  I drink up to a dozen cups a day, so I use my tea ball quite frequently.  My major complaint with most tea balls, and the reason I must always replace them is that eventually the clip begins to not fasten securely.  Over time this gets worse, and the tea ball becomes unusable.  There are other balls with clips that are a bit more sturdy.

DeLonghi Service and Quality Stinks
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought a machine similar to this one late last year - it broke after about 30 cups.  The 'tap' for the steam jammed.  I'm still waiting for the repaired machine to be returned after 3 months - yes months, not weeks.  According to DeLonghi service it will be another month before it's repaired.  I have no faith this will happen, nor that it will work for any length of time after I receive it.  Their service people, while reasonably pleasant, don't help - they know virtually nothing and seem reluctant to go beyond just answering your questions.  If you're smart, you'll go buy a coffee machine from someone else

I bought these classes earlier today because they are attractive and inexpensive.

I am simply amazed that anyone can be satisfied with this pan.  I bought this pan last week.  I fried bacon it on medium heat (as advised by salesperson).  Bacon stuck.  Fried eggs on medium heat.  Eggs stuck.  Ok, must be my fault--try low heat.  I fried bacon on low heat.  Bacon stuck.  Fried eggs on low heat.  Eggs stuck.  Pan would not come clean with hand washing and mild soap (as the instructions advise).  I promptly returned the pan and got a non-stick.  My life is much better.  Do NOT be fooled by the pan's good looks.  Think its just me?  My wife's sister bought the same pan.  Her report: everything sticks.  My sister has the pan.  She hates it!  Guess what?  Everything sticks.  How can a product be so popular and perform so aweful?  You are hereby on notice.

i have a lot of experience with steamers over the years - mine as well as others used in stores. stupid me, then, for not realizing that you get what you pay for. my jiffy steamer finally died after nine years, but it served me well. it is a machine of substance, solid parts, very stable. trust me - you don't want to scrimp when it comes to working with a device designed to produce streams of hot steam! i foolishly tried to save some money by getting the conair gs10rh, and i'm returning it immediately. the well into which the telescoping pole sits is just about 1 inch deep - not deep enough to keep the pole stable. the brackets to hold the telescoped parts extended aren't firm - any heavy jacket will make them slide. the housing itself is amazingly lightweight; i thought that was a good thing, but now i know why the jiffy steamer's housing seems like it weighs a ton - you really do want the unit to be solidly anchored. handling a steamer is a serious matter. don't take on unnecessary risk by getting an inexpensive, poorly designed, lightweight steamer like the conair. spend the extra money for the product that has been the standard bearer for years: jiffy. you won't regret it. and even though mine died after nine years, i have no regrets, and now i'll do the right thing and get another

Not good design
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The design features for the on/off switch is a good idea if you have dry hands and are prone to dropping things.  Otherwise, the on/off switch is not good at all.  The button is hard to press down and is a trigger type switch that does not allow for the blade to be left in the on position.  You actually need to keep a lot of pressure of the switch to keep it going.  The blade was sharp for the one and only time I used it.  I took it back right after Thanksgiving

This is the worst blender I've ever used. Bought it to make smoothies, but it has a hard time grinding frozen things. It never completely chops up frozen fruit, so I always end up sucking down huge hunks of semi-mushy fruit when I try to blend with this thing. Not pleasant. It's also loud and it moves a lot. Sometimes it vibrates so hard the carafe detaches slightly from the base, and when you lift the carafe to pour your drink into a glass you find a fruity puddle in the base's well. I strongly discourage anyone from ever purchasing this horrible thing

The little carbon filter sounded like a good idea, but my coffee will survive without it. At least it's not a total loss because I like the coffee maker itself. Happy brewing.

I like the solid construction but I also like strong coffee.  This machine does not "spray the entire filter basket". Instead, water dribbles out of a 2-inch diameter ring, leaving dry grounds at the end of the brew cycle. I sent the first one back.  The replacement does the same thing.  KitchenAid customer service confirms that, despite the discription on Amazon, the unit does not spray the entire filter basket.  I'm sending the replacement back also. If you love strong coffee, don't buy this machine

I chose this set of knives because of the Calphalon name (I love my cookware!), German steel use, and the description, "Hygienic fiberglass-reinforced poly resin handle will not absorb moisture, crack, split, or chip."  I was disappointed to find that one of the sets I ordered was already showing signs of rust -- even though the set was unused and delivered in a "sealed" box, all four handles had rust marks

I bought this set of knives 2 years ago.  I have not experienced the rust or pock marks that other reviewers have, and I have been pleased with the way my knives have stayed sharp even with a LOT of use.  The purpose for my buying this set was because of the locking feature.  I have little children at home and wanted to make the knives inaccessable to them.  Unfortunately the locking mechanism is a little too hard to open for me.  Mine gets stuck on lock and then I can't get it open without pulling on it with great force.  And when you are pulling on something full of sharp knives, that is a little uncomfortable to say the least.  I have worried more than once that the force I have had to use to open it would cause the knives to all fly out when it came free.  They never have, but it is unnerving.  I tried to contact Cuisinart about it, to no avail.  No complaints on the knives, and I love that there are extra slots in the block for expanding the set, which I have.  But don't buy the product strictly for the locking feature, it is not worth it

I don't know if this applies to the rest of the Vornado lineup or not.

Worked great the first couple of times.  I didn't keep it on the charger for 24 hours (not realizing that this is a problem) and now the battery only works for 10 minutes at a time.  It's now basically worthless
