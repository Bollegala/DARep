An elegant way of serving
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Its a traditional serveware for serving the soup course The color of the tureen set allows it to be used with many of the dinnerwares &amp; the size is adequate to serve at least 8-10 people.The under plate is something  not found with usual tureen sets which gives it an elegant look but it appears a little overpriced

This is the Best Blender I have ever used. It grinds Indian style batter real good. It grabs and churns the mixture quickly. I am using it for the past 5 months, and there has been no problems with it. The jar is plastic and easy to handle and clean.

this is the best steam cleaner it really gets your carpets looking like new again and I was very surprised that it worked great on old stains as well. I love the attachments for the furniture as a pet owner the attachments and the cleaner work wonders. I especially like the turbo surge button this works for the high traffic areas and I have 2 dogs that like to roll around the carpet to itch there backs and these spots get dirter,so this feature works GREAT for cleaning the deep down areas, makes my carpet's look new again!This is also easy to use to fill the water and empty it too, I am VERY mechianically not smart but this is soooo easy to figure and and use it is a breeze! I LOVE MY  cleaner.

How many men do you know who rave about irons? Let me tell you this iron is a great buy. Ironing has become a breeze with this product instead of a dreadful hassle. I iron my shirts every day before work and it shows. Ironing was never been my favorite pastitme but now I actually set up time in my day just to use this product! This iron makes every shirt look like i just picked it up from the dry cleaners with its easy to use steam function. You can't beat the price too

Coffee/Desert Lovers delight

I got one of these as a x-mas gift a few years ago and love it!  It is especially wonderful around the holidays.  I like to make pies and it is great topping on all types of pies.  We also drink a lot of flavored coffee and hot chocolate in the winter (its pretty cold here at night) and love to top it off with the cream.  I'm not sure about the flavored syrups, but I just add some flavored coffee creamer (international delight or coffee mate) to the container and it makes it taste so good.  It is such a hit at holiday parties that I have to borrow my mom's to keep up with the demand.  It makes a great gift just be sure to get enough off the cartriage containers or you will run out

I love this rice cooker! It replaced one I had for many years,and was sure I would never find another I liked as well.  I was wrong. This rice cooker is absolutely the best. It has replaced the broken one hands down. The rice is perfect every time whether you make 2 servings or serve a crowd, it keeps it warm without ruining it and it is so easy to clean and store.  I would recommend this one to anyone that really likes rice and prepares it often.

I have the Tucker burn guard commercial line, kitchenaid and various designer potholders and I've stopped using them all except these Oxo.  These are great for blocking the heat.  I have smallish female hands and I admit that these mits took some getting used to.  Once I got used to them (after the first or second use) I routinely reach for them.  Its to the point that I don't even have the other ones out anymore.  I am here looking to replace my original set of 3 (2 mits + 1 potholder) and I was surprised by the negative reviews.  So surprised in fact that I am writing this review.  I swear by them

<Text>
This is a durable sprayer, not a mister.  I went through 3 or 4 misters before finding the Hoffritz sprayers.  Mine are 3 years old and going strong.  The misters, including the expensive stainless steel one, simply do not last very long.  We use a LOT of olive oil and these sprayers have held up well.  They do require a good push.   And you get more olive oil than you would with a mister.

Better than trying to cook Rice in a pot!
</Text>

I got this rice cooker about 8 months ago, and I have probably used it once a week since then. It most certainly makes better rice than I could before (cooking in a pot on the stove), but the results are often inconsistent.

I had heard that the shape of Riedel wine glasses enabled one to maximize the "nose" of a wine.   How very true!  I was amazed how much more of the wine's bouquet was immediately noticeable with these glasses.  And, they feel great in your hands.  I highly recommend them for wine enthusiasts

Great for frying eggs, but I prefer a pan with higher sides for omlets.  Every grilled sandwich I've made on this griddle has come out perfect.  My kids use it to make pancakes and they swear by it.  I've found that pre-heating the griddle in the oven first helps it heat more evenly and avoid the hot spots that can occur when cooking on a stove top.  The pre-seasoning works great

I love the glass lids and the cushy handles.

Inexpensive pump machine that really delivers GREAT espresso
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The feature's on this machine are what drew me to choose Krups Espresso Maker. The pump instead of the pressure machines was the first draw. The water tank and its size, not having to fill it every day. The fact that the frothing nozzle moved and the location of it. And nobody makes a frothier frother than Krups makes. I love the lattes and I use a large stainless steel milk steaming pitcher. You can make two cups at once. I use it daily and sometimes more than once a day! It makes a great espresso with beautiful crema. I have not had any problems with this machine.Clean after every use. I can't stress this enough and it only takes a minute to wipe the brew area. And do the internal cleaning with solution often or you will get the slow drips of espresso when brewing because of deposit build ups.  Follow cleaning instructions!

My husband, (a Jaguar lover), calls this the "E-Type of Toasters"!  It is beautifully designed; requires minimal space and is 'simply' sophisticated.  To achieve the "perfect toast" using our old toaster required toasting a slice of bread three times, turning it twice, - now it's one single click.

<text>

At $20 and free shipping this is probably the best deal around for people on a buget. Realistly the retail value is not $80 it is around $40. The fabric is not all that soft however with a few washings it should be great. If the thead count bothers you like some other reviewers spend more money don't complain about it when it's plainly listed. An easy way to solve that problem if you are on a tight budget now is to buy it and then later buy a duvet to make the comforter softer. The only reason I deducted a star is because the bed ruffle is very flimsy. It feels like it would tear very easily. This is not a problem for me as I find them annoying but may bother some people. All in all I think it is a great deal

I love this product , the processor is small but enough for a home kitchen and it doesn't take up much space. It chops , shred , slice but the bad thing is sometimes when making sticky stuff, the stuff goes under the thing that holds the blade and its extremly hard to get out. The other bad thing is the plastic , everytime I use the processor the smell of what I'm making last in the plastic bowl and won't go away until I make something else. And I did clean it very hard. Overall I do Recommend this product to All

The Kitchen Aid hand mixer is actually more than I expected.  It is light weight, easy to use, and has attachments that other mixers don't usually have.  While it is more expensive than your average hand mixer, I definitely feel I got my money's worth.  I have other Kitchen Aid products and they last forever. I have never been disappointed in their performance.

Great invention!   I drink mostly loose teas, gave up coffee some time ago.   Because of work and being "Mom", I spend a lot of time in my car.  I have tried several travel presses and most of them don't trap all of the leaves under the press, especially leaves that unroll as they steep.  This is the most practical travel mug that I've ever seen and the storage compartment is absolutely great for carrying extra loose tea for those all day meetings.  I ordered one for my desk and one for those long car trips

I was thinking about a way to make coffee at work where there was no coffee machine easily accessable. I thought a french press would be a great idea, but all of them seemed to be made of glass and I didn't want to leave my press laying around where I work (we share space with other companies so people come and go). With this mug all I have to do is heat up some hot water in the microwave and throw it in with the coffee or tea (and maybe some sugar). Wait a bit, push down the press and drink. The whole mug is well made out of metal and high quality plastic and rubber. The bottom stores a cannister which holds enough coffee or tea for another cup or two and the seal is tight enough to keep it fresh.

Your lodge will outlive you
</Text>

The effectiveness of this dutch oven lies in its design which served chuck wagons a century ago and campers today!  Cast Iron is ALWAYS a good value for the money and it's indestructable (I'm still using my mother's Lodge skillet that she got for a wedding gift in 1954). This dutch oven, designed specifically for the camp or fireplace cook, goes from the fire to the table with ease. It stews and bakes beautifully - get a dutch oven cookbook and learn how to make campfire biscuits as well as those stews and chilis! Also makes a fabulous wedding, shower, or housewarming gift. Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride a lodge dutch oven and skillet. She'll hand them down to the next generation. Every camper can use this and so can every backyard griller. Highly recommend!

I struggled through many pages of  product reviews and descriptions before I finally decided to purchase this particular brand.  Why?  Because I didn't have a clue on which brand was good or bad, many of the reviews for mushroom/egg slicers were mixed, so I took a stab in the dark, and came up a winner!!  This is a great product, stores easily, and works well.  The curve where you put the mushroom (or egg) is just the right size and is just a wonderful time saver!  I love it

I have bought this timer numerous times, and, after a few years, after it falls into a pot of soup or something, I go buy another. Reasons: a) the programmable timer which allows you to time several dishes simultaneously. b) Sturdiness. Its magnet does not stay glued to the back forever, but otherwise it's durable for an everyday electronic gadget - you should get several years of use out of it. c) It's one of the only timers I can find - and I look at big box stores, major discount stores, the supermarket, etc. - that allow you to time dishes longer than an hour or 99 minutes. This is important for pot roast, big chickens, turkeys, unusual dishes that simmer overnight, and so on.

A great starter piece or addition to your Le Creuset collection
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other products. Le Creuset casts these cooking vessels from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once. For this reason, one pot may look like another, but each is unique in its own way.

Light weight board
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I've owned this board for a year now.  Pros- light weight, you can use very sharp knives on and not get much indentation on the board, compact.  Cons- well it can be a con that it is light weight since if you are trying to cut a larger item it might shift, but honestly, if you just get a cutting board that is larger you'd have the perfect cutting board

I am giving this 4 stars rather than 5 simply because I do not like the way this just pulls on and off. I've never purchased a shaker before though, but I would appreciate one the screws off and on so the top is certain to be on every time! Other than that..it's very sleek and the strainer in the top is a plus

I have used this jigger several times a week since I got it back in November, and I think it's great.  I often make a second round with it.  It is difficult to remove the top with the jigger on, but otherwise it comes off fine as long as you open it up right after you make and pour a round of drinks

This was a simple and easy to use product.  I didn't even have to read the directions on how to remove the blades.  The only downfall is that you can't use very big vegetables.  I use it to make home made french fries.  I had to cut the potato in order for it to fit in the cutter.  Aside from that it's a great product

I never knew ironing could be this easy
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I had a Panasonic teflon coated iron before this.  I didn't have any idea how much easier ironing could be - teflon is way overrated!  Don't get me wrong, I still HATE ironing, but at least now its over a lot faster.  Plus, the iron is always at the right temperature for whatever I'm ironing, and its easy to fill with water.  The only thing I'd like is a retractable cord, but it isn't a real cause for complaint

After reading a recommendation from Consumer Reports I was excited to see this iron for less that the suggested price.  In two days it arrived and I am very pleased with this iron.  Although it is a bit heavier than my old one, the results were great.  No tax?  No shipping?  No parking --- the best way to shop

If you are looking for a nice, inexpensive set of knives, look no further.  This set is very sharp, cuts well and fits into your hand nicely.  They have great balance and apperance.  The box is a little cheap feeling and looking, but allows for a great storage within a drawer or cabinet.

I bought my Vacu Vin set about 4 years ago and it's still working perfectly.  It's so easy to use and it does preserve the wine flavor for at least a few days.  We no longer have to finish a whole bottle in one sitting or risk a spoiled wine.  I've recommended it to a few of my friends and they all say they can't live without it now.

I just moved into my new place and I wanted a new set of dishes that were simple but unique and this set was perfect.  Just like past reviews have stated, these pieces are a perfect size.  The bowls are awesome cereal bowls, the dinner plates are large, the salad plates are perfect for salad or a sandwich w/ chips and the coffee cups are used every morning for my cup of joe.  I bought a second set to make sure I had plenty for when friends came over for dinner.  Speaking of friends over for dinner, on the two occasions that I have had friends over for dinner since I bought the set, people always compliment the pieces.  I am very happy with my purchase

I cant say enough about this set.  The cups are the perfect hot beverage size.  The dinner plates are big enough for any meal and I love the square shape.  They are versitle and fit any style.  They also fit perfectly in the dishwasher and they set straight up and do not fall over so I never need to re-wash.  The salad plates are big enough for salads, desserts, appetizers or condiments.  Bowls are great too

After reading the reviews, I decided to try these, since I wasn't too thrilled with either the cost or quality of the senseo pods. After getting my three sets in the mail, I went to my grocery store, bought the Starbucks Sumatra whole beans, ground them to expresso grind, and went to try the ecopads. I followed the instructions, put the ecopad in the machine (perfect fit), hit the 8oz button, and wa - la! I would challenge anyone to tell the difference between the stuff you pay $3.50 a cup for at Starbucks. I'm definately hooked. I can't see how other reviewers have had problems with these. They are easy to fill, and fit perfectly in the machine. They are a bit messy to clean up, but its a fair trade off for the awesome coffee and the cost savings over the pods or actually going to starbucks. I would estimate I will get 50-60 cups out of a $6 store bought bag of coffee. Basically, one heaping teaspoon fills up the ecopad perfectly. Also I would estimate getting hundreds of uses out of each ecopad - they seem very durable. I am looking forward to trying different coffee's with these. Well worth the tiny investment

Great Sauce Pan
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I love to cook, and own several different brands of cookware, All Clad, Cuisinart, and Calaphone.  This sauce pan didn't disappoint me.  I love it!!  The pan has a wider bottom than most 2 or 2 1/2 quart pans.  This is great if you need to saute onions or peppers at the beginning of a sauce, or if you need a little extra room to stir something.  I am very, very happy with this

It's just the right size for sauteing veggies and meat for one.  Cooks evenly and requires little cleanup.  The preseasoning takes the guesswork out of initially readying castiron cookware for use.

Great Indoor Grill
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have had my grill for a week, we've cooked lean steaks on it, pork chops, and the other night we cooked hamburgers on it.  This is my first indoor grill so when one review mentioned the "George Foreman" grill was a bit faster, I was amazed I thought the Delonghi cooked pretty fast!!  Clean up was really easy and one MUST remember to preheat it.  I gather some have not.  And as to smoking I haven't had any but then I buy lean meats and put water in the bottom if I think the food will drip a lot of fat.  Fat dripping into the large tray in the bottom is what burns and causes the smoke.  I've only used water once, with the hamburgers (no smoking).  This really is a great grill and large enough to be more than satisfying (actual cooking space is 15"x11").  Ease and comfort of use is amazing.  I highly recommend it!

Crock pot cheesecakes!

I got this pan for making cheesecakes in a 5 quart round crock pot.  (There are recipes for these on southernfood.about.com in the crock pot section.)  This a good pan for this type of recipe!  It's an unusual size, more than mini but less than full size.  It's a great size for one or two people.  (Standard recipes and pan sizes always make waaaaay too much for the small household.)

Stainless is better than nonstick - Calphalon is best value!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I purchased a custom collection of Calphalon tri ply pieces in the past six months, starting with smaller pans and working my way up. I am so IN LOVE with them.  This everyday pan is a workhorse and you simply cannot beat the ease of cleaning.  Once you get used to it, cleaning the stainless (versus nonstick) is just as easy - and better because it is dishwasher safe.  Stainless versus nonstick is now my preference virtually all of the time.  For skillet chicken, this is the absolute best you can do for a perfectly browned end result.  I have one piece of All-Clad and I can tell you honestly that I PREFER the Calphalon tri ply to it - though ALL Clad is definitely exceptional.  You will not regret this purchase.

Excellent Blade Grinder For the Money :-)
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I purchased the Cuisinart grinder from Amazon based upon customer reviews just over two years ago after trying two cheaper $20-ish models picked up at local discount stores.  Motors on one of the cheaper grinders locked up in short order; the second lasted longer but the blades rusted after only 2-3 months in a storage building. The motor on the Cuisinart is still going strong, but I had to trash it today.  I have to admit that the blades did seem to be a bit duller after grinding enough beans to make 1-3 pots of coffee per day for two years straight,  but that's to be expected with a blade grinder.  The on/off button broke about 2 months ago; then, last week, the blade housing wore out and broke off while grinding my favorite John Conti beans.  Others have stated that this grinder is less messy than some of the other models, but grinding coffee is a messy undertaking and a necessary evil to get the freshest coffee!  If I don't try a higher quality burr grinder, I may get another one of these!

I purchased two matching cups at the same time and they remind me of Russian tea glasses---a collecting favorite of mine. I highly recommend this all-around good buy

<Text>
This is a decent unit.  For those who don't take the time to read or can't understand what they read the product listing states the scoop included is for a 4 ounce cup(4 x 4 is 16).  The usual sold in the US coffeemaker is a 4-6 ounces per cup capacity.  Coffee instructions say usually measures are for a 6 ounce cup.  A cup is not what you use or the standard liquid 8 ounce cup.  Most advertised 10 and 12 cup coffeemakers hold the same total amount in the carafe. The manufacturer calcultaes what will sell.  This has been going on since I bought my first coffeemaker 30 years ago. Caveat emptor!

great coffee, weak lid
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This maker is the better of the two pod coffee machines I had. It is easy to make your own pods that work very well and you have much better coffee due to fresh grind. My problem was that the part that catches when you close the lid broke. It probably was mostly my fault but it is made of plastic unlike the metal one on the other pod maker I have. That is why the other one still works and the Juan Valdez is broken. IF you are careful not to overfill your homemade pods you'd probably never have a problem with it. Just be careful in closing it and don't force it

I got this for Christmas over a year ago, and it still works great!  I use it most every morning.  The coffee quality isn't as good as my drip maker - no pod coffee maker can ever measure up to a drip maker - but it's very easy to brew just one cup and with no cleanup (except to remove the used pod!).

If you can find a better toaster, buy it, but good luck finding such a rariety!

I dont think it was as bad as the reviews imply.  I've had mine about 6 months now and it still works fine, the only complaint I have is about the settings as one person said it can be the exact same on both sides and yet one side will "burn" and one be "underdone".  I just adjusted these and turned them so they both cook whatever I'm making right, even though it is off by one number compared to the other side.  So thats a fluke for sure which would make it worth buying one without any problems, but frankly I've yet to find such a toaster.  Other then that I've had no problems with this one, I love the look and style of it as well it is so cute and practical other then the above problem.  I would recommend this toaster but as I got it as a gift I probably wouldnt spend the $50 but would gladly pay $30 for it.  I dont think you can really find a better toaster I've done the cheap kmart specials and frankly those dont last as long as this has without much worse problems or burning.

Carbon steel is an alloy which allows one to hone a very keen edge and it is used for very fine cutting tools in general. It does rust very easily and should always be dried after washing, and even wiped with a little olive oil. These knives cannot be left sitting in dishwater, and they should never be run through a dishwasher. If you want to throw your kitchen knives into a dishwasher, buy cheap stainless steel ones

good set of modern looking knives

I have recived serveral comments on how good these knifes look. I am in fact very pleased with the way they look, but even more important is how well they perform. They cut wonderfully (for me at least, but I'm used to cheapy knifes). Yes they will in fact rust, although I haven't had this problem with my set (had them for about four months now) because I only handwash them and dry them immediately.  One steak knife found it's way into the dishwasher and sure enough it came out with a little rust spot, this was easily removed with a little steel wool.  You just have to weight the benefits of the all metal knifes to those that are wood handled or plastic

A good little fan.
</Text>
</title>

<Text>
This little fan does just what I need it for. A bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk. It clips on very well. I even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on. I would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation. That oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful. My reason for no 5 stars is the vibration. There is too much especially on high speed. This could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip. It doesn't bother me but might others. The cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch. I needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan. This was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt.

I make him the instant, no sugar, no fat pudding and by using the hand blender it becomes very creamy and so much more palatable.  So far the blender is working just great

This is a pretty good timer with two timing capability, but the only complaint I have with it is that you have to push a minimum of four different buttons just to stop the timer and get it to stop the led screen from flashing.  However, it has very nifty features and the sound of the timer is not too irritating.  Also, the five minute warning is very useful

I adore this flatware! The weight, the clean lines, and beautiful shape! However, it only gets 4 stars because the knives develop rust spots when put in the dishwasher. To prevent rusting, I have to hand wash them. Admittedly, it's inconvenient and not something everyone wants to do. The spoons and forks seem to do just fine in the dishwasher so I don't know what's wrong with the knives. I'm assuming they're made differently. Gourmet Settings, the manufacturer, does have a warranty on the flatware so if you buy this set you may want to, or have to, make use of this

I've had my set for about a year a half.  I haven't had one speck of rust - I wonder if they had a bad batch at some point??  I would definately take them back.  I can see how they'd be too big/heavy for kids - but for adults they're great.  Fit the contours of your mouth very nicely.  I use mine with Fiestaware and they look great together

I bought this for all sorts of uses in the kitchen and am very happy with the quality of the product. Kitchenaid consistently produces quality products.

Love the board, hate the packaging!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I absolutely love this cutting board.  It works well with most knives (don't use the serrated knives with tiny teeth).  The board is very forgiving with repeated cutting.  They are very heavy and very attractive.  The only complaint I have is the paper packaging stuck to the board.  I've bought 3 of these and I couldn't get all of the "glue" off any of the boards.  I eventually just put the oil on the boards to protect them and that somehow helped get most of the sticky residue off.  MIU France really needs to use something that will not permanently stick to the boards.  I'd give it a 5 star if the sticky residue and paper came off easily

This is a beautiful piece of glassware that adds a touch of class to any table. However...and this is a significant however...a good decanter should be as broad as possible at the level at which a full bottle of wine will fill it. The idea is to have as large an air-to-wine interface as possible, so as to let as much wine as possible &quot;breathe&quot;. This of course is not terribly important for whites and better reds, but younger red wines benefit considerably from being decanted for an hour before they are drunk. Therefore, I suggest this decanter be reserved for whites and reds that are &quot;ready&quot;

good filter for the price
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I could definitely tell a difference in the taste of my water, and hopefully that means it's chlorine free, but I haven't had it tested. However, it must be doing its job because the filter itself only lasts about a month! I think that its life span just depends on how bad your water is. It works better that my old Brita filter, which I could tell wasn't working because my water still smelled like chlorine with that one. That being said, I would buy the PUR pitcher over again if given the choice

Perfect for New Users
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have never owned a crock pot before, so I was a little apprehensive.  I did a lot of research and finally settled on this item because of size, price and shape of the unit.  I am extremely happy with the product.  It is perferct for a first time user - not too complicated, but has eveything you need to make the most basic or more complicated recepies.  It did not smell at all on first use (many pots have that reputation).  It is very attractive and fits nicely on my countertop.  The inner ceremic part is very sturdy and cleans up very easily.  I do recommend for first-time users that you purchase one good cookbook (many are carried on Amazon).  I purchased several, and my favorite so far is "The Gormet Slow Cooker"  I have tried several recepies and they were all perfect.  I am converted to crock-pot cooking!!

cast iron convert
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
i was looking for a non non-stick surface griddle to cook pancakes on and i got so much more.  my husband and i are concerned about the effects of dupont coatings on our children's long term health (he is a doctor) so i have been searching for a stainless griddle for ages. finally, i happened upon cast iron as an option.  i never really understood the benefits of cast iron and it seemed so high maintenance -- all the seasoning involved.  i was also reluctant to use it because you are not supposed to really scrub it clean which goes against my personality.  plus, where would i store my seasoned not so clean griddle when i was not using it.  well, the thing is ... when am i not using it? (and when i am not i store it in my oven)  i use it almost every day.  the grill side works great for bacon, salmon, hamburgers, chicken--anything when i don't feel like firing up the grill.  so far everything turns out perfect, not too dry.  the griddle side is great for pancakes and eggs and truly non-stick without the chemicals of a coating to worry about.  The bottom line is...I love this product more than any other kitchen item since my kitchen aid mixer (another love of mine).  i plan to buy more as gifts for all my family and friends with gas stoves (I am not sure how well it works with electric eyes).  truly a kitchen basic.  if you are thinking of getting one, you should

Twenty bucks for three name brand skillets is a great price.  They are not part of Farberware's higher end line (obviously from the price.  any educated consumer will recognize and admit this.)  The bottom line is that they do what they're supposed to do.  We are replacing a very heavy Revereware Non-stick pan my wife bought 1.5 years ago.  The teflon wa flaking off.  She had paid $45 for it.  we decided that most of the supermarket non-stick frying pans we've had over the years lasted 1-2 years and they were usually $13-20.  This Farberware set is a great value

My favorite grill pan
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have owned my fair share of indoor grills, from a Foreman grill to a really heavy grill pan which I ordered through Amazon. Not too long ago I recently acquired the Calphalon grill pan because my Foreman grill is too small if I want to cook a piece of meat and some vegetables at the same time. Plus the black coating on my Foreman grill is wearing out. So I bought the Calphalon grill pan when it was on sale at a local department store. I haven't been able to get enough of it. It is so easy to clean even when I had cooked a piece of meat that was marinated in Italian dressing or in my own concoction of ground fennel seed, garlic, shallots, and extra virgin olive oil. The marinade will of course stick to the grill which is expected however cleaning it off the grill pan was so much easier than my last grill pan which was heavy and difficult to clean because it wasn't non-stick. I also like using the Calphalon grill pan because I can cook both the meat and vegetable (say asparagus) at the same time. The results are fabulous. I get those wonderful grill marks and grill taste. Although it is a bit big for this apartment dweller, I still consider this grill pan the best of all the indoor grills I have owned. Well worth the money too

I'm thoroughly impressed by this set of inexpensive skillets: each of the three are the right size for my use:  Small skillet for nice round pancakes, larger skillet for general stir-fry, the griddle for bacon, eggs and toasting bread (with more than enough real-estate to cook two of three at the same time - could have crammed in the bacon but that releases too much fat).

This pan is nicely made, and is fairly thick silicone - but when full, it is floppy and doesn't hold its shape on the sides.

I understand now why some more expensive silicone pans have wire "sleds" to support the pans

I find the size of each item comfortable to use. The fact that they are dishwasher and microwave safe is just another wonderful bonus. Now I am looking forward to adding more pieces to my collection.

We're a busy family of four. This product has so many more uses than our old toaster plus it cooks fast & it's simple to use! This has been a great alternative to heating up the oven for a few pieces of cheese bread or a snack pizza. I was surprised at how evenly everything cooks. We've been very pleased with this product, in fact it has become an essential appliance. The only draw back is that it takes up more counter space however that con is overweighed by all the pros. I never thought I'd give up my old toaster, now I wish I'd done it ten years ago!

For those of you that enjoy cooking and the best for your kitchen, these dutch ovens are a must!  Excellent for slow cooked stews, roasts and soups.

No sticking and no taste or metal reactions plus the colors are so attractive, they can be a really nice accent in your kitchen.

I pretty much agree with ILikeAmazon's review below.  This blender looks nice, sounds quiet and doesn't dance all over the kitchen when being used.  The lid stays put and it's easy to clean.  It also matches all my other small Kitchen Aid appliances.  Like others though, I make a smoothie every morning and I've had to learn how to use this blender for that.   First, it's helpful to let any frozen items sit for awhile in the blender (I load it as soon as I get water on for my coffee so it can sit until the last thing I do before leaving the house).

I was looking for a kettle with a handle that I could pick up without using an oven mitt, and one that doesn't require removal of the whistle (also with oven mitt of course) before pouring.  This kettle fit the bill.  The handle as well as the whistle are plastic and cool to the touch.  The whistle flips up with a touch of your thumb and does not require removal.

(The electric ones take up valuable counter space and tend to spill the liquid contents.) The Oxo is easy to grip, easy to turn the knob and I appreciate the little jaw-grippy thingy on the side to help seperate the can and lid.

I have used analon cookware since 1997.  The handle came off one of the saucepans.  Before I could return it, my husband tossed it out.  I replaced the saucepan and purchased some additional items.  They arrived in great condition and in a timely manner.  I have used the pots and they have met my expectations.  I would like to order some of the other accessories.

Easy to handle
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I like the two short handles versus the one big handle on other boilers.  This is a little less obtrusive on the stovetop that the one handle design.  It would not work well for sauces or other tasks where you need your other hand to wisk or stir.

BEWARE -- this is a HUGE pan
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Farberware classic is great -- an inexpensive yet equally functional alternative to the very expensive pots & pans.  Note: recently Farberware reduced its quality, in that older Farberware pots & pans had their thick aluminum base completely encased within a stainless steel shell.  The newer pots & pans have the aluminum base attached to the bottom, but not encased within a stainless steel bottom.  So, their quality is less than it was; most people who "grew up with Farberware" may not realize this.  Farberware used to hold the patent on the technique of having the aluminum base CURVE up the side of the pan -- they no longer do this, and are the same as many other manufacturers.  Also note: if you are buying a 12" pan, this is a HUGE pan, since it has a squareish cross-section.  I found it to be so absolutely huge -- you could fry a dozen onions in this monster -- that I simply never use it.  The 10" and 8" sizes may be what you're looking for

<Text>
These sheets are pretty good--they're nice and heavy, and I definitely feel like they're going to last a looooong time.  They are a little bit stiff, and they don't seem to be softening up too much as time goes on.  I expected them to be a ton softer.  They are really good sheets, however, and I would buy them again

Just compare this one with Braun, try to turn it on without the coffee beans and you would notice Braun is louder than Toastmaker, this is quiet and grinds well. Just got it a month ago, not sure about the life of the machine. But I believe its Cheap and Best

A solid no-frills toaster oven
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
We celebrated 45 years of marriage and a toaster oven has been a kitchen essential for all of those years. The Cuisinart TOB-50 is number 4. It's predecessor lasted for 24 years so it has high standards to meet and I'm optimistist. We choose it for it's simplicity, solid feel, and size hoping for reliability and ease of use. In it's early months it is meeting our expectations. It is one of the most solid and basic that I've seen on the market. The controls are solid and easy to use. It toasts evenly and you have the ability to control the darkness of the toast easily. My baking use has been limited but it does a good job of heating small portions that you don't want to microwave. The door and the hinges are solid feeling. It is a nice size without being too bulky. We store it inside a cupboard so size was an important factor. It will toast 4 slices of bread or 4 to 6 waffles depending on their size. It has a soft bell to let you know when the heating cycle is done. The crumb pan is easy to use making the unit easy to clean. The only "con" I can think of in this unit is that the shelf does not pop forward when you open the door so you need a hot pad or shelf pull to pull it forward safely

Good oven - beware warranty pitfalls...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
We had had this oven for a couple months when the door would no longer stay shut.  I tried jamming a wooden spoon against it to hold it shut while cooking, but found this sort of absurd.  So I called Cuisinart for warranty service.  They said they'd replace my oven with a new one, but I had to pay to ship the oven to their warehouse in NJ and it would take a few weeks.  In the meantime my husband found a set of little magnets at our local craft store, and fixed the problem!  So I wasn't going to ship the oven to NJ - until a replacement oven arrived...before I even sent the first one out.  Hmmmm.

Best Coffee Ever!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have owned this for years and LOVE it. The directions indicate that for 1 lb of coffee, you add 5 cups of water and let it sit (for hours). I actually add 9 cups of water and the coffee concentrate works just fine. I fill my ice cube trays with the coffee, then bag the cubes so that I can use it over time. It is delicious every time when you put the concentrate in a 3 to 1 ratio with water (American coffee) or less for stronger coffee (e.g., espresso). I particularly like to use these cubes for iced coffee -- it comes out nice and strong, not watered down.

Great Skillet, The best part is that its MADE IN USA
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
The skillet is great for for frying huge amounts of chicken cutlets when you want them all done at the same time. The quality of the cast heats evenly and stays hot as you add food into the skillet. Its much better then using teflon... (Did you know if you burn teflon it kills birds, especially parrots) Well I never liked cooking in teflon and I have always loved a set of skillets that was passed down from my great grandmother all the way down to me. I am able to sear meats and gently cook scrambled eggs to perfection. Its important to realize, looking back to people that traveled the country on horse back carried a cast iron skillet and a dutch oven... Those same skillets are still in use today.. Try so to the same about your teflon or stainless steel pan from china. Just a good american made cast iron skillet and its very affordable to!!!

I'd purchased the "big brother" to this KitchenAid cutting board about a year ago, so I understand the frustration of the reviewers who complain about the apparently unremoveable label. (It sounds petty until you try to scrape it off yourself.) The label DID eventually come off, but it did take a bit of muscle.

Never an empty pad!
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
We purchased the pad for the senior cat in our house.  At 14, he is the oldest of 5 - all indoors.  We put it on the bed (his favorite daytime nap spot).  He loves it, but so do the other four.  They all try to squeeze in on it, with him, or take it over when he gets up.  It's never empty!  It has a bit of a "crinkly" noise but they don't seem to mind it after they try it. It seems to work great and very easy to keep clean.  The patterned side can be de-furred with a few quick swipes of your hand, following the direction of the fabric nap.  Good purchase and endorsed by all 5 of our cats

This Corelle set has that handcrafted italian detailed look but without worrying about everyday wear-and-tear. It's time to retire my old butterfly pattern which I've had for decades. I rate it four stars only because it would be so much more practical to sell these in SETS OF SIX. It's more profitable for Corelle but not so practical for us. Yes the bowls are shallow and the mugs are stoneware so they are not break resistant.

My friend purchased the Breadman Panini Maker a few months ago.  Every time we spoke he was making some kind of Panini sandwich.  He raved about this panini maker so I had to get one for myself.  I LOVE IT!  It is so easy to clean.  It is such a wonderful item that I would've paid double the price if I new how well it worked. It's hard for me to believe that anyone could be disappointed with this item.

These are well-made spoons, not junky at all, which is always a possibility with cheap, mail-order items of this type.  The steel is heavy-gauge, and all the edges are rounded and safe.  Good value and a good way to &quot;top up&quot; an order

This sturdy nylon whisk, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure-absorbing, non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you'll prefer this product to the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries.

Makes The Best Coffee
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I have owned at least six other coffee pots and was never satisfied with home made coffee, so Dunkin Donuts was where I would head to on my way to work.  I got this coffee pot and I buy Dunkin Donuts coffee and grind it with the Proline Kitchenaid Grinder and it is the best coffee I have ever had.  Recently I had a kitchen remodel and the electrician showed up with his cup of coffee in hand from Dunkin Donuts.  I asked him later in the day if he wanted a cup of coffee and he was hesitant stating he did not like coffee from home coffee pots.  Well, I assured him he would love it. After having my coffee, for the rest of the week he never showed up with his own coffee, actually said, he preferred my coffee.  After the job was over, he saw my sister a few weeks later and he mentioned how he missed the coffee I made.  This is the best ever, perfect coffee every time and the perfect temperature.

Great filter-- noticably reduces dust.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Even on its highest setting, it isn't very loud. Handy electronic screen shows how much longer it is until the filter needs to be washed or vacuumed. I used to wake up in the mornings because I had a stuffy nose due to all the dust where I live, and now that's gone. I would say this is a worthy investment to anyone who is looking into buying a HEPA filter, but doesn't want to go broke from the filter costs.
