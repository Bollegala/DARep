This is a wonderful album, that evokes memories of the 60's folk boom, yet contains original songs. I was amazed at the fantastic harmonies and musical arrangements.

On one hand, this CD is a straight ahead instrumental rocker, but Johnny A really shows how great he is with ballads, such as his covers of "Wichita Lineman," and "Yes it Is."  In fact, those two ballads alone are worth the price of the CD by themselves.

this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an Atreyu Album. It dies today rip off the former bands style, but they are still a very good band.  In the over-crowded metalcore market of today, that is a rarity.  My only complaint, is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice (as heard on "The Radiance), but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music. still 5/5 material though.

Like I said I would, I finally got around to purchasing this CD. I especially like tracks 9-12. Cheap Trick is solid as always. I have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases. If I do have any criticism at all, it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled Trick riffs. I guess it's hard to create new stuff after 30+ years. Anyway, there are some great tunes on this. Buy it like I did!

Ok good CD. im not suprised. Ok jaheim may not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will with the voice that he has.  Yes yall this album does use profanity but the songs actually have meanings. I like that daddy thing song, and like a dj. This album looks at issues from a mans  point of view. Ya know we've heard the angry woman and how the man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view. Ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it well. Also this is a break from that [...] that is played on the radio.

As we all know by now, Lil' Jon is not known for his lyrical capabilities, but for his platinum productions and ability to find guest artists perfect for his songs.  He is truly the king of crunk.  Many of the songs on the album are much like the hit single, "Get Low" feat. The Ying Yang Twins- strong pumping dacefloor beats, lots of swearing and yelling constantly Yeeah!, Whuut?, and Okaay!  Buying the edited version (if there is one) would be a total waste.  This album is not for the meek or faint hearted!  Much of the songs hardly have many words from Lil Jon himself, mostly from the featured artists.  These include Petey Pablo, 8Ball and MJG, Chyna Whyte, Pastor Troy, Jadakiss, Styles P., ect.

Relationships and drug use are major themes.  This album starts off with two absolute killer tunes, lets down some but has a joy thoughout.  I can't believe this is going to be his only album.....what a shame.  From someone who has been listening to rock for a long time, I tell ya, this is a blast.  Pure fun.  Something you might want to give to someone you have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of being in love.....mostly rather quickly paced.  One of my favorite albums of the 90s.  More people should listen

I Didn't Think It Possible

I didn't think it was possible for the Delays to top their debut release - but they have. While "Faded Seaside Glamour" is more immediately catchy and refined, "You See Colours" comes at you in a much more intense manner. The songs are more mature, the musicianship is top-notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies. The high points for me are Valentine and Winters Memory Of Summer, but there's honestly not a bad track on this release. The Delays put it all together - great songwriting, strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something for everybody. It's a shame these guys don't get more recognition here in the States. Buy it

Don't Talk.......

Just lay back and listen. Brian Wilson never misses a note. His voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop. His composing and arranging skills are without peer and he even plays some awesome bass (the slow middle eight section on &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;)on this album. These songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling  both excited and uncertain. Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves, this is a true pop magnum opus. The best tracks are the gorgeous &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder&quot;), the title cut, and the tear inducing &quot;Caroline No&quot;. Instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity, Brian Wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that haven't aged a day since 1966. The more you listen to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, the more it's beauty envelopes you

If you like vocalese, then this cd is for you.  The song selection and performances are excellent.  In my opinion, it stands up with the best Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross stuff.  It is clear that a lot of love and effort went into the making of this record.  Buy and enjoy

I can honestly say that when I first heard Scarling's "So Long, Scarecrow", I was less than impressed. I've been into Scarling for a few years now, and when I heard their first record,"Sweet Heart Dealer", I instantly fell in love. I somewhat held it above everything else, I was so impressed by it. So when I heard the progression from SHD to SLS, I was a little bit let down.

New Power Soul Is Created
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This album sparked the so-called "Neo-Soul" movement years before it was adopted by other artists. Back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and Prince broke the music back down to its roots. This concept was later used by Tone Tony Toni, Brand New Heavies, and D'Angelo.

This has to be one of the most beautiful CDs ever recorded. Damien's vocal range is vast; his musicianship excellent; but it's the crafting of songs at which he truly surpasses most artists. Haunting, sensitive, flowing, crashing...  (If I have one criticism, it's the mixing levels - at times, his vocals are drowned. In concert, when he lets rip, you really feel the power of his vocals/music, which, unfortunately, doesn't come over quite as well on the album.) A truly magical album.

I had tears in my eyes when I first heard this album. I get emotional over music I really like, and this album got to me.So many great standards so well delivered by the duo. They deliberately chose slower ballads for this album so don't look for uptempo,snappy songs in this one.Not that Harry Warren could not write faster stuff like Jeepers Creepers,Shuffling Off to Buffalo etc. This album is to sing along with softly or hum.I kept thinking of Bogart in the rain in Casablanca and other lovers in W.WII.I know the main tune in that movie was not by Harry Warren;it simply reminded me of great love tunes from that era by Julie Styne[Time After Time] and the grossly underrated Harry Warren.Grab someone you love, some good wine and savor one of the great popular composers and a great duo.They should do more Harry Warren albums,Michael and George.I thank them profusely

Still Good
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Poison the Well are one of those bands that I was really big on right when I first started listening to them, but which faded a lot pretty quickly.  I can't really say why.  I like their work, but it doesn't inspire me the way it used to.  Still, I do like them, and this album particularly.  Maybe not as much as Opposite of December, but whatever.  Yes, this isn't as 'hardcore' as their older stuff, but I've never been hardcore kiddie.  (I'm a metalhead)  And frankly, being a modern hardcore band ain't much of a compliment in my book.  It's funny, lotsa tech-metalcore and other 'core derived bands are good, but most straight hardcore/metalcore is staggeringly boring.  So, while old PTW was semi-technical metalcore, this album is pretty much just extremely loud emo.  But, they now how to be 'emotional' and not come across as sissies,(well, most of the time) and Jeff doesn't sing in an unbearably affected manner.  Course, the 'extremely loud' part helps a lot too, and Jeff's growls/screams are absolutely devastating.  Way  better than on their previous albums, and some of the best extreme vox from anyone, ever.

Wonderful instrumentals and lyrics.  A Shenandoah Lullaby is simply beautiful.  I love the way the ending segues into Brahm's lullaby.   His version of Arkansas traveller is refreshing.  Teddy Bears' Picnic is a quaint song that few people have heard.  There Ain't No Bugs On Me is my two-year-old daughter's favorite, judging from the way she belts out this song and giggles from time to time.  I like all the songs on the CD.  A breath of fresh air for parents who prefer real instruments to synthesized pop.

I rarely write reviews of music but feel that I must share my impressions of this CD.  I have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of Townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records.  I finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers--Lyle Lovett-"Lungs" (among others) and Steve Earle-"Tecumseh Valley".  I was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording.  Other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other Townes' records.  I come from a different angle.  As someone who has long heard Townes sopken of with the highest praise, I can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings.  I will also say that I am deeply frustrated that I never took advantage of the chance to see Townes perform while he was alive.

Without a doubt, the highlight is the DVD of the 1975 show in London.  "Born to Run," the album, had put him on the cover of "Time" and "Newsweek" the same week in October, 1975, one of the very few times that has happened for a non-news story.

Really Good Album Actually
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This outstanding effort by Prince consists of mostly spare jazzy R&B tunes, driven by incredibly loose, free-flowing live instrumentation.  I could only begin to tell you about the stylistic variety on this album.  With the three disc format there is a lot to absorb, and the third disc really can largely be done without, but the first two truly do rank amongst his best work.  It should also be noted how especially romantic Prince is on this album.  This album was made around the time that he entered into his first marriage, and it shows because this c.d. is overflowing with outstanding romantic ballads.  Most of his albums only contain one or two ballads, so if you've been longing for an album that includes more, then this album should really appeal to you.  This c.d. does not fit into the "standard" Prince "mold" ( I know that it is perhaps a bit oxymoronic to speak of a "Prince mold" but his personal signature is not quite as bold on this album as it is on many of his other works, even those that are admittedly not as good).  The reason for this is that Prince follows rather than leads on a good portion of this album.  The fact that there are two covers on the first disc alone shows that Prince was in the mood to do what was being done instead of doing something new (he covers songs by Bonnie Raitt and The Stylistics) which is unsual for this constant innovator, but this album is so great because he is so skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else.  One minor problem that I notice is that it seems that on a few songs particularly on the first disc, Prince just doesn't pay much attention to the lyrics.  There are too many generic R&B come-ons and cheesy cliche 90's catch phrases such as "gettin' your groove on', and Prince is much too clever, witty, and creative to resort to such things. But, really that is just a minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding throughout the first two discs.  And then, he has songs such as "Soul Sanctuary" and "Let's have a baby" which are two of the most well-written ballads that I've heard from him.  "In this bed I scream" is just magnificent both lyrically and musically.  He takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way.  This clever, poetic, and romantic track has an infectiously catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance floor.  Other highly impressive moments include the high powered funk of "We gets up", the absolutely brilliant and stunning arrangement on "Curious Child", and the sincere, pure passion of the just so perfect R&B/gospel blend of "Savior".  "Joint 2 Joint" is impressive just for having so much variety in terms of sounds and elements, with each part so effectively enhancing a different part of the story. The first two discs are really solid overall.  The third disc however finds Prince trying his hand at techno and other forms of conventional dance/club music, and the results are not very impressive.  But, I don't see how they could be, even coming from Prince.  Techno for the most part is insanely repetitive, monotonous, and downright drone-like.  There are only three songs on disc three that were really worth it (Slave, My Computer, and the title track).  Well, maybe four, his cover of "La la (means I love you)" is actually really good too.  Those songs could have been put on the first two discs and the 3rd disc really could have been omitted.  The most impressive feat that he manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great chorus and a great song out of the line "www 'dot' emale `dot' com" on "Emale" :-).  I was unaware of this feat for a while because I used to always skip this song because it started off with that really annoying 90's G-funk whistle.  So overall, this album really does rank amongst Prince's best work, and it should especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more ballads and dive into more R&B

I would say that this is the closest that Cheap Trick ever got to making a perfect album. There are only two songs on here that I'm not one hundred percent crazy about...the slow and gloomy depressing title track and ' On the Radio ', which I think kisses up to radio D.J.'s too much. I love the rest of this.

I was waiting for this cd for a very long time, i mean i love all Greg's album, they are intense, passionate, but Amber Headlights is giving me back the soul of the Afghan Whigs, somenthing i missed a lot for a long time . I love his voice, the way he sing, the way he loves his music. You can t explain the beauty of this cd, there are great rock-blues-love songs:the first time i heard "So Thight" it makes me jump up and down my room (i haven t done it for long time since Black Love "Going to town"), then Cigarettes (what a great song, this time i only remember i was singing the chorus with "Gentleman" in my hand), then "Domani" that in italian means tomorrow, kind of Greg's jazz slow song in which his voice is so low that you can t even try to sing like that.Then song after song i realized is the best cd i ever bought after so many years. If you don t know anything about Afghan Whigs and Greg Dulli then it is time to start to listen one of the best alternative artist of our time.

These guys and this album rocks.  Just because the songs force you to move other parts of your body beside your head, doesn't 'demote' it to pop.  Props to the great use of two bass guitars.  Released amid the misery/grunge rock explosion of the early 90's, this was a great escape into rock that just simply made you feel good again. This album is highly recommended.  Kill Your Television, Grey Cell Green, Cut Up, Throwing Things, Happy, and Until You Find Out are just an awesome experience.  If you can find the Grey Cell Green single release, I highly recommend that for the track entitled 'Trust.'

I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang.

There are some amazing moments on this record.  I find myself freaking out to three songs in a row, and waiting for the fourth song to end.  The De La collaboration is weak; it's got the great Wild-Style instrumental but the chorus is obnoxious.  Some of the more R&B-toned tracks fall flat in my opinion.

I was a big fan of this band's song "Rock'n'roll highschool", and I recently saw the documentary about them, so, when I saw this anthology selling for around $15 in Australia, I thought I'd take a punt by buying it. My thoughts on this album are similar to the ones I had for the 3 CD Johnny O'Keefe collection [reviewed at this site by me]. Namely, overall, the album is very listenable, with some standout tracks. As with the JOK album, this album is/was great value for money, considering how many songs you get for the price.

This is one of my favorite releases from Common. This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks. This is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone's collectio

Growing up with Classical Rock and having enjoyed rock music by Rod Stewart, I didn't think I'd like this CD. One evening I was having dinner at a friend's home and they had this one playing. It was beautiful. Being a little older now (in my early 40's), I enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now. This CD of Rod's was nostalgic, romantic and extremely easy to listen to.

Best rap group since N.W.A.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
These guys are the best group out right now. Every single rapper is AMAZING even Bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics. This album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho, Fight Music & Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty & Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.) & Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group) Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable. If you don't have this yet, you are missing out on one of the best cds ever

Joan. You don't love me. Because I'm a guy. But I have loved you since 1976. Ok so I'm an old man (age 43). So what. She's just the best rock and roll female on the planet. I like the young ones like Sahara Hotnights and the Donnas as well but they just don't measure up to Joan Born To Be Bad Jett. This album - like most of her other albums - consists of a mix of old and new songs. Doesn't mattar. I love it. And the video... well it confirms what we have always known. Not that it matters. The music matters

Nothing at all like boy-band CDs (InSync, Backstreet Boys, etc like editorial compared it to).  While some of the songs are over-processed and don't allow Clay's strong, clear, and beautiful voice to shine through enough, it is overall a very good CD. It has some catchy tunes on it.  His second CD, Merry Christmas With Love, allows his wonderful voice to shine through even more

Superb concert recording
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I was at the Brighton concerts that these recordings were mostly taken from and as a reminder of two stunning nights of music they can't be better. Standout tracks include the two by Martha Wainwright, the two by Teddy Thompson, Perla Batalla's "Bird on a Wire", Rufus' "Chelsea Hotel"  and (from the Sydney concert) Antony's  "If it be your Will". Two major disappointments though; the inclusion of U2 as backing band for Leonard Cohen's own version of "Tower of Song" seems done for purely commercial reasons and doesn't work,  and the nonsensical ommission of Linda Thompson's sublime take on "Alexandra Leaving". Here's hoping it's included on the dvd release

I Had To Laugh When I Read the Booklet....

<Text>
...because it felt like it predicted that I'd be listening to the cd someday.  I'm referring to the line "The kids of AD 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense of well being and warmth that we do today."  Now I admit that I was 18 in 2000 so I guess I technically missed the literal kid description by a year, but the more general prediction of the inter-generational, timeless appeal of the Beatles was right on.  I didn't see them on the Ed Sullivan show.  I was born almost twelve years after they broke up, and about a year after the tragic shooting of John Lennon.  But I, like many, many other people born too late to have experienced Beatlemania as it was occuring, have since become a huge fan of all their work.

It's sometimes hard to think there are really anymore pleasing melodies out there, but thank Halstead & co. for proving me wrong. I am happily pleased with their latest, and very eagerly awaited, effort. Instead of the depths of melancholia and loveliness on, say, OUT OF TUNE, they give us 41+ minutes of what seems like basically "it's good, everything's going just way OK..." It's happy. Maybe I'll hear a lyric later that says something else, but for those for whom music is the priority, you can't go wrong with this considered and experienced and artful pop. Four and a half stars

I bought this CD on a whim after I heard Joaquin Phoenix was directing their "Tired of Being Sorry" video.  Whoa!  I was addicted!  I couldn't stop listening to it...I had to get a 2nd copy for the car just so I could stop carrying it back and forth.  GREAT driving music!  The songs are catchy and have a great beat...I haven't heard anything this good in a long while.  I had to have more immediately and luckily found some earlier stuff of Scott Thomas'....more on the acoustic/indie side, but awesome!  I highly recommend Lovers & Thieves (CDbaby.com)  My faves from Ringside are "Struggle", "Trixie", and "Dreamboat 730". You will not be disappointed

Attell is one of the few decent comics out there right now. I wasn't that big of a fan until I saw this in a record store and decided to give it a shot. I'm running out of comedy albums, there's not that many good ones out there. So I bought it and I was impressed. The audience is obviously drunken college kids who were very familiar with the show "Insomniac". They would laugh and scream if just slammed the microphone into his forehead the whole night. He has very good timing and delivery though and his jokes have very unpredictable punchlines for the first time you are hearing them. You never see the punchline coming a mile away. He is vulgar so if you are sensitive in any way to graphic sexual scenarios and profanity, stay away. He is one of the few that I enjoy now, tragically Mitch Hedberg died in March because he was another. The increasingly popular Dane Cook doesn't do it for me. Cook's Retaliation CD has broken all sorts of records for a comedy album. I think Cook is very marketable to the college, 20something crowd, guys like him because he's the loud obnoxious drinking buddy from the frat, chicks think he's cute. I recommomend Attell myself, he is vulgar but is just a better comedian

This album is incredible.  For me this is one of those few albums that defines a time in my life.  An album that for months I played over and over.  An album that I've played countless times, that I have passed out to when I came home after a late night, that I have ran to, and worked out to, that I play at work for a pick-me up.  It's great.  It's filled with so much emotion and passion, from beginning to end its just brilliant, the entire album.  The songs are composed more like classical music with sweeping scores that start off slow and steady and then build up and explode into these intense jams.  I love it.  You have to buy this album.  Then buy their next self titled album.  Then play it and play it, and play it.  It grows on you.  I can't wait to see them live...

<text>
<Text>
One of the best Doobie collections out there "Greatest Hits" lives up to its name focusing on the singles the band recorded and that charted in their long career. Some of the songs here are the single versions (meaning they were edited and are shorter than the album versions)and this might be a problem for some fans as they may want the full length versions of songs. Maybe it's because they were trying to squeeze more music onto the CD. Either way fans may want to be aware of that.

The Sundays come out with a CD once a decade, thus putting me in constant cravings for new material. Though Camera Obscura is very original and very much their own band, they satisfy the cravings that only Harriet Wheeler could touch. Truly vast and intimate at the same time, and a voice that speaks to something very deep, sad and lovely inside you

Michelle Branch carved out a place for herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with Carlos Santana.  This record is her first with friend Jessica Harp.   The ladies mine the borderline between the singer/songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format.

What a great album this is, not only is the music a real pleasure to listen to, but the lyrics are a hoot! Wayne is not afraid to experiment, he skillfully combines old school elements with new in such a natural way. The songs pull you right in as if your listening to an old favorite you haven't heard in a long time. This album instantly became one of my favorites. I bought two more to give as gifts.

ART NOISE TRASH TERRORISM AT ITS FINEST
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
1978 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of  Cleveland. Just like their other fellow Ohion's DEVO, the guys in PERE UBU obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.I have owned this recording in various formats since 1980 and I have never grown tired of this album. I find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years ago,  if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and re-record it, it  just would'nt happen. There is just a certain magic that they  captured in 1978, as to the music itself I tend to break - up this  album into 2 distinct parts. Side One being the more accessible "drunken" side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise, but a little too intelligent, just listen to the lyrics.Side 2 is definately the "drug" side like a bad acid trip vocalist David Thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of Cleveland(I have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric) and the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going off in a million different directions.I could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize, experience and consume at your own leisure, and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album  mean to you. So if you loved things like Throbbing Gristle's song Hamburger Lady then u will surely love Pere Ubu's album the Mordern Dance.As another reviewer mentioned before Black Francis of The Pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guys.I also hear there influences in recent  bands such as Portishead and Queens of the Stone Age just to name a few.So if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album, even if you have to beg,steal or borrow it.

I feel bad doing this becuase I love Iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad. All the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating. It's like the first Beatles Anthology set: the material is amazing but the quality is bad. On the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise. The packaging is also very nice. I just though I'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set. If you are a Stooges fan don't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait.

The Best Four Seasons Collection Ever
</Text>
</title>

The Four Seasons have always been one of my favorite groups. I think Frankie Valli has one of the best voices in the world and without the doubt the greatest falsetto in existence, and the rest of the group had harmonies that only The Beach Boys could match. nd for band that has had as any hits as them are destined to have a barrage of greatst hits collection. Up until now, I always felt the best way to obtain all the Four Seasons' best songs was by getting Rhino's single disc "The Very Best Of The Four Seasons". Well, I was wrong. "In Season: The Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons Anthology" is the definitve Four Seasons collection.

Dave Alvin's sublime new CD is a cadre of songs written by Californians either born and/or who grew up in this land. The lyrics talk about what it means to live and love in the land of dreams and broken promises. It is also a look at the story of the frontier in this large western state. Dave Alvin has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said "infiltrates your brain like a shot of Jack Daniels."

Electronic Sounds
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Well, here we are.  One of the true works of the electronic genre in the 90's, "Lifeforms" is true sonic adventure.  This is obviously some of the best work that FSOL ever did.  "Lifeforms" is a double album of electronic and ambient moments spliced together, interchanged and meshed.  For ambient work, it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a rapid pace.  There is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs, despite their being ambient.  It is very original, I praise originality in music.  Give it a try, put on some "Flower" "Bird Wings" or some "Elaborate Burn.

It's no "Antics in the Forbidden Zone"
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I'm really not sure what the purpose of this Disc is, other than as an Adam Ant filler for those collectors who need to add more to their collection.  This is a slightly scaled down version of the truly best of "Antics in the Forbidden Zone" which detailed Adam Ant's career up until the bombastic "Apollo 9" album.  "Essential" adds the 1990 single "Room at the Top" from "Manners & Physique" album and "Wonderful" from the 1995 "Wonderful" album.  These two songs are not really worth the cost of admission and I think are probably the weakest songs on those two albums, anyway.  And of course "Essential" ignores the unreleased 1993 album "Persuasion" which had some really good songs on it.  If you want later period Adam Ant, "Manners" is really good and "Wonderful" is, well, less than wonderful, but still a worthwhile Adam Ant.  If you want an introduction to Adam Ant, the chronologically catalogued "Antics" is great and a more complete collection!

I love jazzy hip-hop of the early '90s and if you do too,this is the album you must listen to! all the songs are wonderful but there are some of these which are something of supernatural like the famous (and the most beautiful of the entire cd!) "Award Tour", "Steve Birko(stir it up)" and "Midnight".

Soundtrack of an Era!

...wandering through the dorms in the 1970's this was one of those albums that was in everyone's collection. It was usually very near the front of the record stack. Every time I hear that opening guitar riff from Reelin' in the Years I glide back to a very nice place in time. If you hope to understand the evolution of US pop/rock music you need to become intimate with this recording!

The more I listen to this album, the more I love it. What's sounds somewhat familiar even formulaic at first becomes totally captivating on further listening.  Like a girl you thought was nothing special at first glance but then becomes beautiful as you get to know the complete package. This is one cooooool CD.

Collin has done it again.  I didn't think I'd enjoy a CD as much as his &quot;The Walls Came Down,&quot; but &quot;Tracks&quot; is just great.  Every song is better than the last.  You can't go wrong with Collin Raye  and you can't find anyone with a better voice.  Buy this one

A Universal Truth

The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally "learnt the language," and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.

The Pet Shop Boys - You Rock
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Like many of the highly talented and innovative groups of the 1980's, The Pet Shop Boys were ahead of their time.  This album was purchased mainly for "West End Girls" and "It's a Sin."  Play this album from beginning to end without interruption - it's fantastic.  "Loves Comes Quickly" emerges for me as the best of The Pet Shop Boys remarkable and unique sound - a composition reflecting orchestral complexity and pulsating energy.  The great contributions of Great Britain and Australia to music in the 1980's in my opinion comes largely from their composers and performers effectively combining the power and harmonic complexity of some classical music compositions of the mid 1920's to the early 1950's (no doubt the origins of some great movie scores) with the emerging sophistication and always present upbeat effect of rock and roll.  You will love The Pet Shop Boys

i recently saw them in san francisco just like one of the other reviewers, and i thought it was astonishing. i know a lot of people got mad cause they didnt move around or anything, i mean it couldn't be because they were trying to concentrate or anything like that! the great thing about this album is that all the instruments standout at the same time. farina(the lead singer)has calmed down after the last couple of albums and often times speaks his lyrics in a soft and heartfelt way that make you wish you could get into a conversation with him right then and there.and his guitar playing has even matures after the bed is in the ocean. the drummer just flat out rocks. his punctuality is a lot of the reason why these guys are so tight. the bass speaks just as well as the guitar does and sometimes takes over as the guitar holds it together and the bassist go off on his own little excursion. well, if you have a problem with a band not rocking out, i dont know what to tell you. it is jazzy, but let me be the one to tell you this is the best jazz i've heard. i think this is the only path they could of taken. you got to evolve. sometimes that cant always be a good thing but in this case ,karate is the exception. love this

Brian Regan is simply a comedic genius.  This cd is especially funny after having seen him live--you can just picture his hilarious gestures and facial expressions!  He has managed to create a hysterical routine based on the silly stuff we've all said/done/thought.  While I too enjoy comedians who are more "cutting edge", I don't think a routine has to be peppered with profanity to be funny.  This cd is well worth any price; check out his DVD and his live show, too

EDDIE WHO INSPIRED THE WHO

You can resume EDDIE COCHRAN very well with one cd.After all,when he died he was only 21 years old.This selection is almost the same if you except 5 songs of the LEGENDARY MASTER SERIES released in 1990.His best songs are there:SUMMERTIME BLUES was of course a favorite of THE WHO ,who often featured it in their concerts.I am particularly fond of JEANNIE,JEANNIE,JEANNIE,C'MON EVERYBODY and the marvellous SOMETHIN'ELSE with it's great shuffle,a trademark of EDDIE.If you are interested in rock's early days,you'll enjoy this cd
