I've always held the philosophy you are what you're entertained by. So, those who like Ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women. And speaking of women...Ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o.

This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed.

Ok, so the song playing when Brian goes and we see mia for the first time is a song called "Deep Enough (Urban remix)" by Live.  I have the other songs written down, including the one played between the two buildings, so I will find them and tell you.  If you all want only the songs that were actually in the movie, rent the dvd, and take about ten minutes to watch the credits and write down the song names and artists.  That's how I have only the songs that are in the movie

Ben Gibbard has grown a lot as a songwriter.
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
There are 2 really good songs on here.  The first is "Untitled," which sounds like Gibbard was listening to a lot of Brian Wilson at the time he wrote it.  The percussion sounds like it could have been on pet sounds.  "Underwater" is a pretty good song...but the real jewel on the album is "Send Packing."  It really is a beautiful, well-written song.  The rest of the album sounds kind of thrown together and most of the songs would have been much better if they had been recorded with real instruments.  Basically, the novelty of the kid instrument thing wears off really quickly.  All in all, I wouldn't spend 10 bucks on it, but a couple tracks are pretty good

Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL

"Maiden Voyage" appears on innumerable lists of jazz masterpieces, and it is clear from the first listen that both the composition and the playing are at a level of technical proficiency unmatched on most albums of this era or any time afterward. Nevertheless, the finished product is not one that all listeners will find appealing. To these ears, this album seems aimless and even somewhat annoying. The songs meander without clear structure and Tony Williams' drumming seems at times to be going in a direction opposite that of the rest of the band. The influence of this album is indisputable, but its enjoyability is a more subjective matter. If you enjoy groundbreaking, cerebral jazz such as the music made by Miles Davis' second quintet, then this album will probably work for you. If, on the other hand, you favor Hancock's earlier and more accessible albums "Takin' Off" and "My Point of View," this album may be a bit of a letdown

I'm an avid tony yayo fan, but this album just didn't cut it. maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure. i don't know. but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them. Hopefully his next album will be way better. a few songs are good to listen to. I would think, coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about, but "so seductive" being your first single?? come on. i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean.

I can't believe rubbish like this goes platinum. Rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. People like Chingy, Nelly, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Lil Jon and any other idiot with Lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke. What is really getting me angry is how so many people don't give any respect to real rap legends like Tupac and Biggie, and give tons of respect to all these clowns. People are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people talk about is money, bling bling and sex. Rap used to be about the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. If you want a real rap CD then get one of the following.

<text>

Before you get all worked up, let me say that he has a voice, but he really doesn't have a style.  he sings songs way too straight, he makes even Bobby Short sound like an improviser!  He also doesn't seem to be in touch with his masculine side, his vocie is very, well if ying is male, and yang is female, he sounds very yang.  He needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious, then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying(masculine side) in his voice.  He needs to hear a few Billy Eckstine lp's.  I don't think he can change but here's hoping he'll take my advice.  As far as you buying this cd it is your decision, this is just my honest opinion

Many albums, including this one, have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks.  The use of many poetry elements in their lyrics can't save the blandness of the music.  "What About Everything" and "Life Less Ordinary" are good songs.  The rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep.

The ROCKFORD FILES.....and where did the jazz go?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Sounds like the background music used in the 70's Rockford Files TV crime show...and a little like the CHIPS music too. Similar to music by Tom Scott from back then. The crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky, they are more smooth groovin funk. The sound for the times is very clean, too produced for true funkyness. Don't get me wrong I like the old 60's JAZZ crusaders, just not this 70's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent, and continue to do so, it's where the money is.  No improvisatory feel either. This is for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed, as will true jazzers.  I wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened, even to this day, afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. Their 70's albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz... in other words, not really jazz, not really funky, just kind of smooth groovin, more for casual adults and offices. not challenging, not offensive, formulated to an extent. But hey if you like this, that's cool, just dont think it's real jazz, or real funk. It's smooth and casual, slightly simmers, pleasant background music, but doesn't COOK like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz, funk, and fusion. It just sounds like they are holding back...I know they can play more advanced, and write more creatively, they just choose not to ever since the 60's

Limp Melodies and So-So Songwriting

Now on their sixth studio album (and second on a major label) Carbon Leaf plays it safe with the inoffensive rock/pop of "Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat." Lead vocalist Barry Privett has a warm, pleasant way of delivering his lyrics, and renowned producer Peter Collins fulfills his duties. Nevertheless, the 11-song collection is most notable for its power of subtlety. In fact, it is so subtle that not one song is memorable.

Shame on you John Waters for putting your name to a complete load of rubbis

More Producer-Driven Than Artist-Driven
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I think India is one of the most talented artists today. Her voice is sensational. Sadly, as with many great artists today, this album feels more producer/market-driven rather than artist-driven. I understand that Regaetton is popular right now. I would even understand including a few Reggaeton-flavored songs to "keep up with the times" (Shakira's "La Tortura" comes to mind). But who mixes two genres within a single song?!? "Soy Differente" flows perfectly as a salsa, until Regaetton beats come in. The style feels very out-of-place in this song, as in most other songs in this album. Maybe this kind of thing will work at a club, but not for extended listening. In my opinion, the producers are making this album more marketable while stiffling India's own style. I hope she will regain contol by the next album

Childish Things Misses and Tires
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Mcmurtrys new album really disappoints.  I am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with James past work (as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical).  While Mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza (See the Elephant) or that provide an echo to the way we Americans spend our time (Holiday), his attempts on Childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing.  In past attempts Mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of Americana, yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside. The thoughtfulness evaporated on this work.

Is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks (Clapton, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell) to the occasion, as if it's some monumental event? Please! As if the Band were anything worthwhile in the first place. Sorry, but the whole concept of a bunch of Canadians (well, four of five anyway) writing this stuff about Americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it doesn't get much worse than that stupid shot of Levon Helm wheezing through "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down."

Michael Jackson is one of the most gifted songwriters/singers of our time. You can discuss his person, you can discuss his behaviour, and all the other stuff, but you can't really take that away from him. And that's exactly why this album is so unacceptable, coming from someone like him - when you've reached superstardom and gone beyond it, you don't release a record that's so horribly mixed up and full of second grade tracks that it's bound to be a faliure. At least, you should expect to hear for it. And hear for it he did, cause the critics didn't go lightly on this one. And it's not that bad, actually. I mean, that's what I have my program function in my CD-player for, and my CD-burner.

I felt like I was taking a piss on myself the whole time I listened to this album. What happened to the 40 water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1, 2pac, and mc breed? This clone of 40 raps with the likes of Lil jon (wack as hell), washed up 80 year old too short, and a bunch of losers I have never heard of. The album only gets props because eightball and mjg are on the album and ugk. And they almost played themselves by appearing on this god awful so called "album". E-40 has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk called "hyphy" in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless career. The album has some decent beats on it but there is no kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. E-40 wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Krs-One cd. This cd is wack simple and plain, Pee-40 is a beat waster, and he needs to find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!!

I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job, plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort.

Man, can she get anymore stupid and talentless. She needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits. All the songs on this album are totally unlistenable! She completely lacks power, vocal range and versatility. Jennifer Lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today. She gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career. Just because your a great actor/actress doesn't necessarily mean you can sing, too. Some actors/actresses were able to achieve it, but not Jennifer Lopez. She needs to quit the music business while she still can. Please stick to acting...OH, WAIT! I forgot, she can't do that either!

I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with their excellent 2nd CD, Demon Days. The interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so "out there" that when you first hear one of their CD's...it sounds like complete garbage. But once you listen again and again, you start to like it more and more. Eventually you end up really liking the CD.

John Sinclair is abominable as George - he sounds like he's doing a (bad) imitation of Michael Crawford in &quot;Hello, Dolly.&quot; He does strange things to his words - I guess he's trying not to sound British, but why is he singing &quot;Summ-ar weath-ar&quot; instead of &quot;summer weather&quot;?    The Ilona is a bass - almost literally. &quot;I Resolve&quot; has been lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. To accomodate her, the second part of &quot;I Don't Know His Name&quot; has a truly odd key change. Were she remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate her singing, but she's not worth it.    The orchestrations are odd, too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE NOTE of &quot;Days Gone By.&quot; Luckily this is his only song.)    The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original) outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the annoying Judy Kuhn.)     Get the original or revival recordings instead - this London version I would recommend only to die-hard SHE LOVES ME fans, or masochists. I'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; than listen to this again

Mediocre jazz recorded in MONO
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Neither the Amazon review or any of the customer reviews recently submitted mention this fact. I have few classical and pop recordings in mono that do not impact the listening experience such as 'Songs for Swinging Lovers' - Frank Sinatra or Beethoven's Opera Fidelio - conductor Otto Klemperer (Testament Label). The material on these recordings are so good that the listener completely ignores the fact that they are mono recordings. I did not hear anything outstanding on this CD to make me overlook the 'mono' factor.

He's the biggest thing in comedy?  Really?
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Man, have I given this guy a chance.  Multiple chances.  Listened to the CDs, saw the big HBO special.  I mean, his career is red hot now.  He clearly has lots of fans.  Mostly college age (perhaps this should be a warning to some of you).  All I can say is "maybe they'll grow out of it."  He is NOT funny.  His act has no bite, no point of view, no opinion/viewpoint at all.  His comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to (the "this is all happened to us" or "has this ever happened to you?" school of humor).  He runs about manically, acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth (for those in the audience that may not be so good with words).  His fans acknowledge that, yes, they can relate.  "Yeah!  That's happened to me!"  "I know that reference!'  They laugh, cheer, clap, and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit.  He never actually COMMENTS on the things he discusses in any intelligent, interesting way.  He has no edge.  He's not outraged by anything.  He's cute 'n' cuddly.  Richard Pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that Cook is classified as a stand up comic.  "Pryor?  The guy writing this must be OLD!'  Okay, try this on for size:  Chris Rock is good comedy.  Same with Dave Chappelle.  Carlin.  Laura Kightlinger.  Kinison.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Bob Saget.  Gilbert Gottfried.  Dom Irrera.  Lewis Black.  Robert Klein.  The late Mitch Hedberg.  Jim Norton.  Patton Oswalt.  Brian Posehn.  DeGeneres.  Jon Stewart.  Bob & David.  The UCB.  I'm not even a big fan of Sarah Silverman, but at least she's trying to bring something different to the party.  Anything but this!  God help us.  Let's hope he goes the way of Carrot Top and Dice soon (don't forget, Cook fans, Mr. Top and Mr. Clay were once as popular as your boy here)

Alright, if you absolutely HAVE to have a Garfunkel solo album...
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par

This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out w/a holiday album.  It seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only  original material, but non-mainstream music.

I have not heard of or listened to, this cd series, but from the sound of it, its all bad interpretations of popular music.  I just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff... play classical music.  Play stuff without lyrics.  Play a show on tv where the characters sing.  Do anything but, buy a cd where people that aren't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place.  Censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song.  There are just some songs that aren't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words.  Think about this... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song?  Listen... I'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible, but cds like this are not the way to go.  All they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff, they're gonna be asking questions.  Do them and yourself a favor and don't buy these cds

This album is the worst DCFC album, why......... Ill tell you why its boring, its repetitive, its way to mellow and im all for mellow but this is ridculous. I mean this is the type of mellow that puts people to sleep, especially the last track. OH MY GOD!!! THAT SONG IS SOOOOO BORING, its called Stability and it will put you to sleep. I am a fan of DFCF and i loved their other albums WE HAVE THE FACTS, PLANS, etc..... but honestly this album did not click with me. i tried listing to the songs again to see if i would probably grow accustome to it, but no that didnt work. Sure this album has its moments, but trust me when i say your not missing out on anything. I would not buy the album, instead buy the 2 stand out songs off itunes or napster; A MOVIE SCRIPT ENDING and WE LAUGH INDOORS. The only 2 stand out tracks

The CD is great!!! The legendary Johnny Cash comes thru loud and clear on this CD. However, it took Amazon over 30 days to deliver this item and that was only after numerous emails to them.

TICKED OFF
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I bought this cd after hearing Tony on one of the am morning shows, and really likings some of his past offerings, but I have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money.  I was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money's worth.  Tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years, and I expected a more mature offering from him than this latest.  There is a great lack of maturity on this cd, and it's an overall disappointment.  Unfortunately, I have to say here that Toney is not alone.  What on earth possessed veteran soul singers the O'Jays to sing a song like Let's Ride?  Who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages?  Hoochie mommas?  What?  Babyface?  Even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd!  And what's up with the explicit lyrics?  We all know you can curse like sailors, but why is this language necessary in music?  And I know that artist have always performed their music, but will someone tell me why it's necessary to perform with so few clothes on?  I would rather hear your music, not see your booty! Sorry, but a review I just read triggered me, and I'd been thinking about the Tony Terry cd for a while.  Hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time.  Meanwhile I think you're safe in skipping this particular cd

I love to hear old standards and such.  But I like to hear people who put their own take on it.   I can't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some Frank Sinatra wannabe.  Where are the male versions of Nora Jones?   Tone down the cheese!  We need more people like sophisticated Shirley Horn and Betty Carter(NOT hams like Buble, Dusk, or boring singers like Diana Krall.  But what can I expect from the music industry?  Rarely do the best song-stylists get lots of attention.  So, hmmm, nevermind.  I guess it's always been that way

Based on other reviews here and comparisons to Jellyfish, Jason Falkner and the Beatles, I was expecting a lot better.  Instead I find this work very shrill and hard to listen to.  Is the guy talented musically?  Yes.  But his voice is mediocre and his songs really don't do it for me.  Sorry but I feel the need to give an honest assessment so others won't be mislead by the breathless reviews here.  I am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre

There's a review here that compares Hank III with Hank, and then suggests that Hank III adds to the legend with his clever lyrics.  I think that person has never listened to Hank's stuff.  It's hard to compete with, "You wore out a brand new trunk, packin' and unpackin' all of your junk."  That's my favorite Hank lyric, and there are many, many more--very, very clever, very hard to compete with.  That said, I love III.  He has a hard way to go, and apparently he's going it.  I can't even imagine the dichotomy he faces--looking and sounding like Hank, and I'm sure he loves that, yet wanting to do his own stuff.  I bought his first CD as soon as I knew about it, and I've been waiting for this one.  On the first one I was disappointed with his writing (but he's a kid, for pete's sake) and was knocked out by Wayne Hancock.  On the other hand--I didn't know III existed until I saw him on Conan O'Brian, and he was one of those performers who makes your head whip around and hit the "record" button so you can find out who he is.  I've listened to everything on Lovesick Broke & Driftin' and I love it.  Except for Atlantic City--once you've heard The Band do that, you don't need anything else.  Hank III, however, is on his way, and I'm rooting for him.  He's got the stuff.  (And, by the way, to echo the sentiments of others on this board, I don't listen to country anymore, at all!  It's way too pop-commercial-boring-who cares!)  I haven't listened to a country station for more than 10 years.  Go, III.

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the "music" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.

As much as it pains me to say it this live cd is not a worthy billy joel release. In fact one wonders why it was released at all. Billy's voice is strained and is prone to over singing and the arrangements are overblown. From the sound of things Billy sounds like he was drunk or on medication. A lot of the running time is waisted with lengthy monologues with the audience. Why this was put on the CD is anyones guess but it just neans less songs!

I am very disappointed in this CD.  Not because the music isn't good, because it is.  But because it is just not the Pat Green that used to play in Stillwater.  The passionate, soulful Pat Green.  Back then he sang about things that he believed in and loved.  Now he is singing what Nashville tells him to.  And this coming from the guy who sang "Nashville Sucks" with Cory Morrow.  There are a ton of country singers out there that could have released this CD and it would have sounded exactly the same.  But songs like "Southbound 35" and "Three Day" can only be sang by Pat Green.  He needs to revisit his roots and come back to the red dirt country music that he was born to play.  Will the real Pat Green please stand up

I bought this album because I loved the title song.  It's such a great song, how bad can the rest of the album be, right?  Well, the rest of the songs are just filler and aren't worth the money I paid for this. It's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe. Kenny Chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the Nashville music scene.  He's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town.  I'll get down off my soapbox now.  But country music really needs to get back to it's roots and stop this pop nonsense.  What country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things.

Where Beyonce's sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album, Cole's raspy voice and sometime-y pitch concern me.

Chingy is perhaps the most generic rapper in the world, he is a wack lyricist and all he ever talks about is gettin pu*sy.  Along with several other wack commercial rappers of recent years he tarnishes the name of hip hop, and because of retards like this non hip hop listeners dismiss the genre as cr*p and talentless (which is not true).  Jackpot went multi platinum, which speaks volumes about the number of idiots who will buy anything with a tight beat.  In fact the beats aren't all that bad, if this was an instrumental this would actually get a higher rating as I would not have to listen to his irritating voice.  If you heard Right Thurr in a club and thought it was tight (like I did), you are wrong, Chingy did not produce this album so he deserves no credit for the beats.  His lyrics are absolute garbage, what is sad is that a loser like this can get decent production, and some top lyricists have to work with nothing.

They have some ok melodies and words, but for the most part all their songs sound the same.  Good Charlottes first two CD's were almost good, but this one is bad and really whiny

Disappointing

This soundtrack was `heart-brokenly' disappointing to me mainly because it lacks a few songs that were in the film.  I bought this soundtrack for one specific song (and it would've been worth every penny if only it was included): the song near the end when Alexander marches through the desert to return home to Babylon after his recovery.  Such a disappointment that wasn't included.

mediocre compilation goes on and on

This album made me realize that darn record company produces, for examle, two regular albums; two best albums; two tribute albums; and finally two mixture of everything under a sounds-like-new-but-actually-an-old albums  from a musician. This is an example of the mixture of previously released,  re-released, at last, over-released best tracks with a sounds-like-regular  album title.  Let me tell you one thing. JP is dead and gone since Rob left  the band. I doubt there will be more regular JP albums but you'll have  plenty of compilations like this coming out until you stop buying

This CD Sucks

AFI used to be a pretty good band. Then, they decided to go emo-girlie-boy. The lead singer has made adramatic change from smelly-goth-dude to perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy. What happened to smeely-goth-dude? Some of us actually like the music, not the "emoness". Not only that, but "Miss Murder" was waaaaay overplayed, and now it is encrested into my brain. I mean, come on, it's not even that good of a song.

Re-Record?????? Paging Miss Emily!!!!

Despite all the rave reviews I'm wondering if this is a dreaded rerecord. Maybe I'm paranoid, but the country music industry is so sleazy. And some stars feel entitled to cash in. How else can you explain the John Anderson Anthology...Horror.  (John, how could you?) Or the Bill Anderson Oh Boy Classic [Oh boy here comes a rerecord). Hey, the CD sounds great. But what makes me suspiscious is that there are no copyright dates anywhere on this CD except for one. Also the cryptic message on the inside sleeve.  Could someone please clear this up. And not some RCR Bud Logan shill either. John Conlee is one of my hero's and this is really worrying me. I can't look at this CD with Rose Colered Glasses anymore

rip off

This music is a rip off. All is borrowed to the 4 first albums of Marc Bolan playing under the name of Tyranosaurus Rex. Something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy.

I bought this album after hearing America, their single off this album, and listening to the increasing hype about Razorlight and Johnny Borrell being one of the most talented singer-songwriters of his generation. This follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. The songs all sound like I've heard them somewhere before, and the lyrics - well, how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone, nothing on the radio, and not known what it all meant, while smoking cigarettes late at night. Yawn...

Travesty
</Text>
</title>

The Kidz Bop series is the ultimate travesty in music. And don't think that it's good just because your kids might love it. Kids also like to eat McDonalds, but don't try telling me that their food is healthy. There is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children. And, surprisingly, a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children, even with the expletives deleted. There is no reason on earth why these records should exist, excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish. I agree with the person who suggested the Beatles as an alternative. Seriously, don't buy this!

Juelz should be missing his tongue
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money

Worst Bone Album of  all time
</Text>
</title>
<text>
<Text>
I am a huge fan of BTNH, but even I will admitt this is not a good album. The worst being "Home" which uses samples from Phil Collins. The whole thing feels kind of empty, with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works. There are a few songs worth listening to. Most notably is "Clevland is the City" which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any "harmony" to it. Other songs worth mentioning are "What About Us", "Not my baby" and "Pump,Pump",the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage. It is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released

This CD is not at all what it appears to be. They got other people singing and playing the music, so it's not what you're probably looking for. Terrible misrespresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I used my other party cd's or my guests would have left......and I would have held the door open.....not blamed them for leaving!

Wild Card is the best song on this cd.  The rest just didn't do it for me and I didn't care for the Latin flavor.  This cd was a mess.  If the rest of the songs were along the lines of Wild Card, I would have kept the cd.  This didn't say Rippingtons to me.
